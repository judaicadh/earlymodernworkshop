description: >
  Meant to commemorate the passing of a loved one by recounting their attributes
  and good deeds, seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Ashkenazic communal
  memorial books (commonly called yizkor books or memorbücher) include numerous
  entries praising women who assisted in various aspects of childbirth. Although
  sources permit only a partial view into the array of caregivers involved in
  childbirth within Ashkenazic Jewish communities, memorial books offer evidence
  of a class of women who, unlike midwives, never underwent formal training or
  licensure, yet played important roles in childbirth nonetheless. Entries for
  these women rarely include any sort of career designation, but instead frame
  their childbirth work as merely one aspect of a larger constellation of
  charitable contributions they made to the community. 

  <br>

  Formulaic in nature, individual entries offer little information about the
  mechanics of childbirth as it played out within the Ashkenazic world. But
  taken in the aggregate, these sources demonstrate that childbirth care
  extended far beyond the scope of a midwife. The provision of food, talismans,
  postpartum assistance, and spiritual guidance were as integral to childbirth
  as the participation of midwives at delivery. Even more so, these sources
  suggest the need for a more holistic conception of early modern healthcare,
  which was not limited to ‘official’ practitioners or professionals and
  encompassed a much wider spectrum of individuals than has often been assumed.
