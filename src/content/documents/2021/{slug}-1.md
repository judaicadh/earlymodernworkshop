description: Meant to commemorate the passing of a loved one by recounting their
  attributes and good deeds, seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Ashkenazic
  communal memorial books (commonly called yizkor books or memorbücher) include
  numerous entries praising women who assisted in various aspects of childbirth.
  Although sources permit only a partial view into the array of caregivers
  involved in childbirth within Ashkenazic Jewish communities, memorial books
  offer evidence of a class of women who, unlike midwives, never underwent
  formal training or licensure, yet played important roles in childbirth
  nonetheless. Entries for these women rarely include any sort of career
  designation, but instead frame their childbirth work as merely one aspect of a
  larger constellation of charitable contributions they made to the community.
  Formulaic in nature, individual entries offer little information about the
  mechanics of childbirth as it played out within the Ashkenazic world. But
  taken in the aggregate, these sources demonstrate that childbirth care
  extended far beyond the scope of a midwife. The provision of food, talismans,
  postpartum assistance, and spiritual guidance were as integral to childbirth
  as the participation of midwives at delivery. Even more so, these sources
  suggest the need for a more holistic conception of early modern healthcare,
  which was not limited to ‘official’ practitioners or professionals and
  encompassed a much wider spectrum of individuals than has often been assumed.
