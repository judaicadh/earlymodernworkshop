  Health care among the Portuguese Jews of early modern Amsterdam has not been a
  much-studied subject. Nevertheless, it was omnipresent and organized, both
  through public health care and private initiative. Health issues in the city
  and around could be very urgent, leading to crises, during epidemics and other
  natural disasters often hitting the area. Besides, many migrants joining the
  Portuguese community often arrived in bad physical state and needed immediate
  treatment. Nevertheless, it is difficult to get close to actual medical
  practice and learn through personal experiences of both medical doctors and
  patients. There was certainly a divide between the well-to-do using private
  health care and Jews on welfare lists who were bound by public provisions. It
  was only in the nineteenth century that the Jews of Amsterdam
  institutionalized medical care. In the meantime, the Portuguese communal
  leaders closely followed and supervised medical care provided, so costs would
  be curtailed. Nevertheless, it seemingly could not cope with the rising need
  of health care in view of the growth of private organizations to that effect
  during the 17th and 18th centuries. In this respect there are many questions
  to be asked, for example into what extent objectives formulated by public
  health care were translated into practice? Or, why the Portuguese community of
  early modern Amsterdam refrained from institutionalizing and modernizing
  medical care till the nineteenth century?


  The source to be dealt with here, a mid-eighteenth-century petition, is unique
  in its sort as it leads us into the home-scene, focusing on the mental and
  physical state of an extremely sick person, not necessarily dependent on
  welfare, but still too poor to survive without help in one way or another. No
  assistants around as his young wife apparently took care of the well-being of
  her husband. On basis of the information provided by this petition, we could
  wonder whether health care, both public and private, was adequate. This source
  will be the starting point from where the structure of medical care among the
  Portuguese Jewish of early modern Amsterdam will be closely followed and
  analyzed.

Mosseh Chamiz Vaz requests Your Lordships very submissively to have so much commiseration with my disgraced and deplorable state to assist me with some help for me as I am in a bed extremely sick , while I have no donkey milk \[to drink\] twice a day and lacking all what is necessary for me and for my inconsolable wife while Pesach is almost at hand, which I need to celebrate and I do not have the possessions to do it, seeking my brothers to help me, but they also have their families they need to take care of, making Your Lordships sure I would not bother you with this petition if it were not that I am dying in my bed and my beloved wife is assisting me night and day without having anything necessary for our food and assuring Your Lordships I am certain that if my brothers would see my miserable state they are and will be satisfied if you would anticipate me till one hundred guilders . Thus I ask that Your Lordships will assist me for the love of God and I will pray to God for this transition from death to life and for your health and that of this K.K. Vesalom

25 guilders is being sent out with the confirmation that the brothers agree to give these 25 guilders.

We signed below David and Joseph Hamis Vaz oblige ourselves at present as guarantors for our brother Moseh Hamis Vaz to the favor of the gentlemen parnassim of the Portuguese Jewish Nation as executors of the last will of our aunt the lady Rachel Medina Hamis for the sum of one hundred guilders which the above mentioned gentlemen will be able to anticipate to our brother Moseh while we are satisfied that in case he would die it will be charged to our income accounts and we sign in truth 15 April 1742
