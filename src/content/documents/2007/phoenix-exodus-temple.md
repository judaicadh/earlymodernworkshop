  This presentation investigates the symbols of the Sephardic congregation in
  Amsterdam, mainly the Phoenix and the Pelican that symbolize the resurrection
  of Jesus in catholic Christianity, alongside the unique exegesis by several
  congregants of the Exodus narrative. The analysis of the symbols, images and
  the architecture of the congregation's synagogue, shows that they had played a
  major role in the construction of the "new" identity of the congregation. By
  utilizing them the congregation established the "resurrection" narrative of
  the Sephardic Jewry and its new beginning in Amsterdam. The rich cultural
  background of these symbols and images, both in the Iberian world and in the
  Netherlands, enabled the community's members to interweave their
  Iberian-Christian past with their Jewish present and to integrate into the
  Dutch society of the Early Modern period.

Limor Mintz-Manor, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel

The book _Praises that zealous \[men\] dedicated for the pleasant memory of Abraham Nunez Bernal, who was burned alive sanctifying the Name of his Creator in Cordova on May 3rd, 5415_ that was published in Amsterdam in approximately 1655, includes many poems in Spanish written by elite members of the Sephardic community in the city. The book was dedicated to the memory of two _Conversos_, relatives of a community member in Amsterdam, that were sentenced by the Spanish Inquisition and burned at the stake in Cordoba.

In the following poems (as well as others in this book) the legendary phoenix is used as a metaphor for the martyrs, who chose to die while keeping their Jewish faith. This symbolic Martyrdom associated with the phoenix was widespread in the writings of the members of the community. The phoenix appears in other texts and images of the community in several contexts symbolizing martyrdom, resurrection and revival.

The description of the newly built Sephardic synagogue in Amsterdam appears in the prologue to a collection of sermons, which were delivered during the celebration of the inauguration of the synagogue in 1675. The prologue, that was composed by the publisher David de Castro Tartaz, describes the circumstances that led to the erection of the new synagogue and the preparations that were undertaken in order to fulfill the project. The author describes the interior design of the synagogue and comments on various aspects of the celebrations. In this account, as well as in other sermons in the collection, there are several references to the resemblance between the synagogue and the Temple in Jerusalem. Indeed, the synagogue's architecture was influenced by a renowned seventeenth century model of the Temple, and this similarity conceals the hope of the congregates for individual and communal redemption as "New Jews" in Amsterdam.

By Mr.  
Daniel de Ribera  
\[...\]  
\[p.41\] The frustrated tyranny  
was there offended  
seeing that from dust and nothingness

Abraham obtained immortal life;  
and amidst the great flame  
his truth was so consumed  
that without difficulty  
(like pure gold in the crucible)  
he turned from earthly (being) into the sun,

from sun to Divinity.

More than much as gloriously

(he) bravely entered the contest  
and from the burning sacrifice  
came out a prodigious phoenix;  
So proudly and so piously  
did he wish to burn himself  
that in the self-sacrifice

between fire and devotion

produced note and admiration. \[...\]

\[p.49\]  
By Mr.  
Semuel de Crasto

Here lives a divine,

the zeal and the fortitude,

the constancy and the firmness  
of the noble celestial award;  
He, who through the right path  
like the phoenix, was burned  
from where he was resurrected,

leaving his fame (behind) in the world,

Another Elijah, who in the flame

triumphantly went up to the sky.
