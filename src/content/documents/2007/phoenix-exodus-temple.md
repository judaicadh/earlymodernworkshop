  This presentation investigates the symbols of the Sephardic congregation in
  Amsterdam, mainly the Phoenix and the Pelican that symbolize the resurrection
  of Jesus in catholic Christianity, alongside the unique exegesis by several
  congregants of the Exodus narrative. The analysis of the symbols, images and
  the architecture of the congregation's synagogue, shows that they had played a
  major role in the construction of the "new" identity of the congregation. By
  utilizing them the congregation established the "resurrection" narrative of
  the Sephardic Jewry and its new beginning in Amsterdam. The rich cultural
  background of these symbols and images, both in the Iberian world and in the
  Netherlands, enabled the community's members to interweave their
  Iberian-Christian past with their Jewish present and to integrate into the
  Dutch society of the Early Modern period.

Limor Mintz-Manor, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel

The book _Praises that zealous \[men\] dedicated for the pleasant memory of Abraham Nunez Bernal, who was burned alive sanctifying the Name of his Creator in Cordova on May 3rd, 5415_ that was published in Amsterdam in approximately 1655, includes many poems in Spanish written by elite members of the Sephardic community in the city. The book was dedicated to the memory of two _Conversos_, relatives of a community member in Amsterdam, that were sentenced by the Spanish Inquisition and burned at the stake in Cordoba.

In the following poems (as well as others in this book) the legendary phoenix is used as a metaphor for the martyrs, who chose to die while keeping their Jewish faith. This symbolic Martyrdom associated with the phoenix was widespread in the writings of the members of the community. The phoenix appears in other texts and images of the community in several contexts symbolizing martyrdom, resurrection and revival.

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Sermons (Amsterdam, 5435/1675)</strong></p><p style="text-align: center"><strong>An Introduction</strong></p>

The description of the newly built Sephardic synagogue in Amsterdam appears in the prologue to a collection of sermons, which were delivered during the celebration of the inauguration of the synagogue in 1675. The prologue, that was composed by the publisher David de Castro Tartaz, describes the circumstances that led to the erection of the new synagogue and the preparations that were undertaken in order to fulfill the project. The author describes the interior design of the synagogue and comments on various aspects of the celebrations. In this account, as well as in other sermons in the collection, there are several references to the resemblance between the synagogue and the Temple in Jerusalem. Indeed, the synagogue's architecture was influenced by a renowned seventeenth century model of the Temple, and this similarity conceals the hope of the congregates for individual and communal redemption as "New Jews" in Amsterdam.

\[p.40\]  
By Mr.  
Daniel de Ribera  
\[...\]  
\[p.41\] The frustrated tyranny  
was there offended  
seeing that from dust and nothingness

Abraham obtained immortal life;  
and amidst the great flame  
his truth was so consumed  
that without difficulty  
(like pure gold in the crucible)  
he turned from earthly (being) into the sun,

from sun to Divinity.

More than much as gloriously

(he) bravely entered the contest  
and from the burning sacrifice  
came out a prodigious phoenix;  
So proudly and so piously  
did he wish to burn himself  
that in the self-sacrifice

between fire and devotion

produced note and admiration. \[...\]

\[p.49\]  
By Mr.  
Semuel de Crasto

Here lives a divine,

the zeal and the fortitude,

the constancy and the firmness  
of the noble celestial award;  
He, who through the right path  
like the phoenix, was burned  
from where he was resurrected,

leaving his fame (behind) in the world,

Another Elijah, who in the flame

triumphantly went up to the sky.

Prologue for the Reader  
\[...\] \[p.iii\] The entire prayer was accompanied by hymns and the most famous songs, and for the imitation of the inauguration of the sacred Temple, which lasted eight days of festivities, always with the same solemnity, each day accompanied by a sermon given by the most talented scholars of the congregation, which are offered to you here. Friend Reader, here you will see the fruit of our distinguished Nation\[1\], you will see the noble our Haham\[2\] as Master, giving beginning to elegance so conceptual and \[you will see\] his worthy disciples praying with elegance of concept. I attest to you, kind reader, that it \[=this celebration\] seems more like the days of Passover \[celebrated\] with liberty in the Temple than celebrations of captivity in a Esnoga \[=synagogue\]\[3\]. I beg you not to thank this work \[=book\], which is not mine, but I only desired to inform you about this good, because I regard you highly. And because you see the image of the Esnoga\[4\] without understanding its architecture, I want in sum to give you pleasure, by explaining to you its models.

To portray for you, discreet reader, all the details that magnificently constitute it, would be impertinent to the report. I \[can\] only assure you that it is the most illuminative of the city, spacious and bright inside, perfect and striking from the outside, surrounded by a beautiful patio with galleries surrounding it like a wall. In it, is the residence of the nobles of the Mahamad\[5\], six rooms for the school, two for the Hazanim \[=Cantors\] and one for the guardian, all in the front. Beside are corridors with columns for passage which include the Esnoga's length : 130 feet, width 100 feet, (and) its height from the ground till the vault \[= vaulted ceiling\] \[is\] 70 feet. It has three doors, and an admirable view from the the main entrance, due to the three vaults that form the whole building. And these \[vaults\] at the sides are supported by walls, and these in the middle \[are supported\] by four pillars of stone. Each one has a gallery for the women to sit, which is supported by six columns in each part.

Five trusses of magnificent chandeliers hang, (with their golden drawing on the vault) and in abundance, that they reach the number of 800 candles. There is a Theba \[=platform\] made from very expensive Jacaranda\[6\] wood, with its \[cover\] copper needlework, adorned with \[p.iv\] metal. In front of \[the platform's\] corridor \[that leads to\] the corners with the pillars, is a curious chair of the Mister, our Haham \[made of\] the same wood. Opposite the admirable Hehal \[=Holy Ark\], completely made of wood of the most curious Jacaranda, (gifted by the very noble Mister Mosseh Curiel, with so much generosity, that he received everyone's applause, almost naming the work after him) so gorgeous, that it competes in artifice with the best of the entire building, completely covered with such curious decoration, that it properly looks like a Palace, and surrounded by admirable columns, decorated with unusual \[plantlike\] embossment, and the gallantness of its columns. Imitating the stone's tablet, there is a wooden \[plate of\] the ten commandments, so grand and costly, that it is illuminating the Gallery opposite it, which is surrounding it. \[...\] David de Castro Tartaz.

DANIEL DE RIBERA  
\[...\]  
\[p.41\] Diosse allí por offendida

La tiranía frustrada  
Viendo que del polvo y nada

Saca Abraham immortal vida;

Y entre la llama crecida  
Tanto apuró su verdad.  
Que ya sin difficultad  
(como oro limpio en Crizol)

De terreno passó a Sol,  
De Sol, á Divinidad.

Mas que Mucho si glorioso

Entró al certamen valiente,  
Y del sacrificio ardiente,  
Salió Phenix prodigioso;  
Tan ufano y tan zeloso  
Deseó de se abrasar.  
Que en el se sacrificar

Entre el incendio y desvelos

Dió que notar que admirar. \[...\]

\[p.49\]  
Del Señor  
SEMUEL DE CRASTO

Aquí vive un ser divino,

El zelo y la fortaleza,

La constancia, y la firmeza,  
Del celeste premio digno ;  
El que por justo camino,  
Como el fenix se abraso,  
De a donde resucitó,  
Dexando en el mundo fama,  
Otro Elias, que en la llama  
Triumphando al cielo subió.
