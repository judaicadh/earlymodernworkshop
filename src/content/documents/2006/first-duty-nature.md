description: "The presentation discusses a letter from Relle \\[Rachele\\]
  Morschene (1770-1844) of Trieste to Chief Rabbi Raffael Natan Tedesco, written
  in the throes of her three-year long effort to extricate herself from her
  marriage to husband Lucio Luzzatto (1755-1801). From 1793 to 1796, Morschene
  pursued separation and civil divorce through the Habsburg courts at the same
  time as a Jewish religious divorce. Indeed, she was one of the first European
  Jewish women to seek and obtain a civil divorce. Her legal situation was novel
  because Jews in the Habsburg Monarchy were among the first to be subjected to
  civil marriage regulation by a modern state. In medieval and early modern
  Europe, Jews had generally followed their own religious law (Halakhah) for
  matters of marriage and divorce. With the Marriage Patent of 1783, the
  Habsburg Monarchy was the first European Catholic state to define marriage as
  civil and to apply civil law and state jurisdiction to the marriages of all
  its subjects. However, it did not thereby create purely civil marriage
  procedures: marriage ceremonies were still only religious, and civil divorce
  was permitted only to those who were allowed to divorce by their own religion.
  Thus, Morschene could not get divorced civilly until Rabbi Tedesco assured the
  civil court that she was permitted a Jewish religious divorce."
