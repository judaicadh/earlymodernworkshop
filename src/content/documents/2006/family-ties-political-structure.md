  In his presentation of two documents pertaining to Jews in Pisa and Livorno,
  Bernard Cooperman discusses the link between family connections and the
  construction of a new formal Jewish community and explores the connection
  between family and business networks. Cooperman argues here that new
  communities in early modern Italy were often structured as merchant companies,
  and it was a family that was a base of trade networks. Family also became a
  method of joining the community, while at the same time families and
  individuals used membership in a community to legitimize a family. The
  presentation further explores interracial marriages and offspring of Sephardic
  Jews, role of women in the community and in wealth distribution. A larger
  overarching argument is that it was in the early modern period that the Jewish
  community was able to create formal structures.

<h2 style="text-align: center">Source 1 Introduction</h2><h2 style="text-align: center">Introduction to Communal Decision of June 8, 1606</h2>

**Notes:** In a petition to the Grand Duke from the end of June 1599, the Massari had already requested and received confirmation of their right to refuse entry into the community. One of the “problem groups” they mentioned were those who joined for tax benefits, engaged in commerce, and then left without bringing their families and settling permanently.

A central problem of governance, one that was especially pressing in the small Jewish communities of Italy during the transitional stage from banking to merchants’ colonies, is how to control the most powerful wealthy families and to impose collective authority on them. This issue is usually treated with regard to moneylenders who had held individual charters and who had now to be convinced that they should obey the commands of elected, non-banker, officials. In my presentation I would like to explore the issue in the context of the merchant colonies created by Sephardic/Portuguese /converso immigrants in Pisa and Livorno at the end of the sixteenth century. Although the issue of restraining oligarchy is not unique to these communities, their problems and responses mark the special situation they faced.

In Pisa on the 38th day of the Omer, 5366 \[June 8, 1606\] The Senhores of the communal council (maamad) are gathered together. Seeing that many people are inscribed in the book of the Chancery of Customs in order to enjoy the benign privilege of H\[is Most\] S\[erene\] Highness who then don’t bring their families nor do they live \[in PIsa\] in accordance with the intention of H.S.H., they \[the Senhores\] order that within four months they \[immigrants\] must bring their families and live in the family way. Otherwise, the said term having passed, they are declared revoked, and they may not enjoy the said privileges. The \[Senhores\] order that in the future noone shall be registered without giving a guarantee of 100 ducats that he will bring his family within four months. And I, David Abenine, secretary (sofer), have written this at the order of the said Senhores. Samuel Boguati. Abraham Fra\[n\]qo Velho \[the elder\] David Montesinos Abram Framco Mose Sullema
