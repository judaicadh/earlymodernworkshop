description: In his presentation of two documents pertaining to Jews in Pisa and
  Livorno, Bernard Cooperman discusses the link between family connections and
  the construction of a new formal Jewish community and explores the connection
  between family and business networks. Cooperman argues here that new
  communities in early modern Italy were often structured as merchant companies,
  and it was a family that was a base of trade networks. Family also became a
  method of joining the community, while at the same time families and
  individuals used membership in a community to legitimize a family. The
  presentation further explores interracial marriages and offspring of Sephardic
  Jews, role of women in the community and in wealth distribution. A larger
  overarching argument is that it was in the early modern period that the Jewish
  community was able to create formal structures.
