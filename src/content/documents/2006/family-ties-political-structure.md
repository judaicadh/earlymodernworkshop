  In his presentation of two documents pertaining to Jews in Pisa and Livorno,
  Bernard Cooperman discusses the link between family connections and the
  construction of a new formal Jewish community and explores the connection
  between family and business networks. Cooperman argues here that new
  communities in early modern Italy were often structured as merchant companies,
  and it was a family that was a base of trade networks. Family also became a
  method of joining the community, while at the same time families and
  individuals used membership in a community to legitimize a family. The
  presentation further explores interracial marriages and offspring of Sephardic
  Jews, role of women in the community and in wealth distribution. A larger
  overarching argument is that it was in the early modern period that the Jewish
  community was able to create formal structures.

<h2 style="text-align: center">Introduction to Communal Decision of June 8, 1606</h2>

**Notes:** In a petition to the Grand Duke from the end of June 1599, the Massari had already requested and received confirmation of their right to refuse entry into the community. One of the “problem groups” they mentioned were those who joined for tax benefits, engaged in commerce, and then left without bringing their families and settling permanently.

A central problem of governance, one that was especially pressing in the small Jewish communities of Italy during the transitional stage from banking to merchants’ colonies, is how to control the most powerful wealthy families and to impose collective authority on them. This issue is usually treated with regard to moneylenders who had held individual charters and who had now to be convinced that they should obey the commands of elected, non-banker, officials. In my presentation I would like to explore the issue in the context of the merchant colonies created by Sephardic/Portuguese /converso immigrants in Pisa and Livorno at the end of the sixteenth century. Although the issue of restraining oligarchy is not unique to these communities, their problems and responses mark the special situation they faced.

<h2 style="text-align: center">Source 1 Translation</h2><h2 style="text-align: center">Communal Decision of June 8, 1606 in Pisa Pinkas Pisa, 1606</h2>

In Pisa on the 38th day of the Omer, 5366 \[June 8, 1606\] The Senhores of the communal council (maamad) are gathered together. Seeing that many people are inscribed in the book of the Chancery of Customs in order to enjoy the benign privilege of H\[is Most\] S\[erene\] Highness who then don’t bring their families nor do they live \[in PIsa\] in accordance with the intention of H.S.H., they \[the Senhores\] order that within four months they \[immigrants\] must bring their families and live in the family way. Otherwise, the said term having passed, they are declared revoked, and they may not enjoy the said privileges. The \[Senhores\] order that in the future noone shall be registered without giving a guarantee of 100 ducats that he will bring his family within four months. And I, David Abenine, secretary (sofer), have written this at the order of the said Senhores.

\[To His\] Most Serene Grand Duke:

Moise Sulema, Jacob Levi, Raffaele Coen, Abram Penso and Abram de Luscena, Jewish merchants living in Pisa, in thier own name as well as that of the other Jewish merchants, humbly state to Y.S.H. \[Your Most Serene Highness Grand Duke Cosimo II} that when the Jews first lived and traded in this city, among the various provisions they made for administering their synaoggue was the order and method of electing the Stewards (massari) who year by year govern and have jurisdiction over the Jews in virtue of the privleges and edicts of Y.S.H. These rules were voted on by all heads of household so long as they were not related nor enemies. This situation continued for many years . But afterwards, because of the lack of merchants, it was deemed suitable to change the stated method, and it was ordered that the five Massari who were about to leave offcie, together with seven other merchants, neither related nor enemies as above, should elect the five massari who would enter \[into office\] for the following year. This rule lasted for about six years, and was revoked as \[leading to\] corruption and fraud. Next, we began to have one merchant per household, so long as they were neither enemies nor relatives, extracted in order to vote for the massari. This arrangement was also corrupted by the same massari who had ruled (hanno dominato) then (pro tempore) and until this very day. They would scheme and form alliances among themselves such that between themselves and their relatives \[people\] would be off one year and then serve the next. In order to maintain their association (collegatione) they undertook (appresso), even though this was always forbidden, that relatives and brothers and enemies for enemies, may vote on all rulings (ordinationi) even though this was always forbidden.

Now disputes and disturbances arise daily from this mode of action, as happened in the past few days (alli giorni passati), which leads to troubling Y\[our\] H\[ighness\]. On the other hand many who are truly real merchants and people of quality are left behind by this \[arrangement\]. We therefore appeal to Y\[our\] Most Serene H\[ighness\] asking Him, for the quiet of the said Nation and to avoid the even greater scandals that may daily arise from the said situation, and also so that those who are truly real merchants will be allowed to share in the honor and office of steward (massaro), that He be willing to order by his benign signature (benigno rescritto) that a container (borsa) be created under the supervision of the Most Illustrious Commissioner of Pisa and of the Conservatore of our Nation \[that will contain the names of\] all heads of household who are truly real merchants and who are recognized, evaluated and reputed to be such. Of these will be extracted by lot each year five, with the prohibition of relatives as above. And so it will continue until the container be empty. Thus greater quiet will be maintained, and there will be further opportunity for other foreign Jewish merchants to come and live \[in Pisa\], for they will know that once they have been approved to live here in accordance with the said privilige, they will also be able to enjoy the office of steward. The reason for bothering Y.H.S. daily will also be removed.

We pray God to grant \[You\] every greatest happiness and exaltation.
