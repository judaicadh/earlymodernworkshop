description: "In eastern France Jewish marriages are well documented in the
  eighteenth century. Following a decree by Louis XIV in 1701 that Jewish
  marriage contracts had to be deposited with notaries within 15 days of
  marriage, these documents were registered with increasing frequency in the
  entire French-German region. Registration became generally obligatory in that
  time, so that we have large amounts of documents both for Christian as for
  Jews. Historians have never fully analyzed these files. Jean Fleury, who was
  prompted by genealogical interests, surveyed the 8500 items in the Metz
  archive, and compiled 2021 marriage contracts from the seventeenth and
  eighteenth centuries that were signed before the rabbinical authorities and
  deposited with a royal notary. Sometimes we have the Hebrew original, more
  often a translation or a shortened version of the whole text either in French
  or in German. The same applies to Alsace: More than 5000 Jewish marriage
  contracts and last wills have been deposited with royal notaries."
