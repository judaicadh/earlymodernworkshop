<h2 style="text-align: center">Introduction to Marriage Contract Between Abraham Jacob and Sara Kassell</h2>

In eastern France Jewish marriages are well documented in the eighteenth century. Following a decree by Louis XIV in 1701 that Jewish marriage contracts had to be deposited with notaries within 15 days of marriage, these documents were registered with increasing frequency in the entire French-German region. Registration became generally obligatory in that time, so that we have large amounts of documents both for Christian as for Jews. Historians have never fully analyzed these files. Jean Fleury, who was prompted by genealogical interests, surveyed the 8500 items in the Metz archive, and compiled 2021 marriage contracts from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries that were signed before the rabbinical authorities and deposited with a royal notary. Sometimes we have the Hebrew original, more often a translation or a shortened version of the whole text either in French or in German. The same applies to Alsace: More than 5000 Jewish marriage contracts and last wills have been deposited with royal notaries.

In a way, these marriage contracts are prescriptive texts; they reflect what was considered the norms. As they differ in many details, they also can be considered individual, descriptive sources. Thus, they show the wide range between the liberty of the individual and the system of social relations.

A contract of 1754 refers to the marriage between Abraham Jacob and Sara Kassel. Abraham Jacob was a rich Jew from Steinbiedersdorf, the most import Jewish village in the Imperial County of Crichingen, which was an enclave in the German part of Lorraine. He was a businessmen and a purveyer to the court (Hoffaktor), who had loaned substantial amount of money to the count of Crichingen and his many officials. During his 57 years in office, he held the post of parnas in the Jewish community of Steinbiedersdorf until his appointment of chief parnas of all Jewish communities in the county of Crichingen. There is much evidence that Abraham Jacob was a wealthy, pious and tradition-bound man. He was married at least 4 times. Sara Kassel was his second wife.

Sara was the daughter of Isaak Kassel, a Frankfurt merchant whose trading connections included Holland. In 1725 she became an orphan and in 1730 she married the widower Raphael Lipmann from Bouxweiler in Alsace (county of Hanau Lichtenberg and belonging to France since the late 17th c.). In Raphael Lipman she not only married a successful merchant but also an active representative of the Jewish community. He had a library of 75 books, which suggests that he valued learning and erudition. Sara brought a dowry of 2300 florins into the marriage, lived together with her husband for 20 years and had at least two children: Keile and Bernard. When Raphael Lipman died in 1750 his business were not doing well. The debt exceeded the active capital and so she decided not to accept the inheritance.

When Sara Kassell remarried in 1754 after four years of widowhood it was probably a well-considered decision. The circumstance that she could retain a substantial part of her property (Aussteuer), despite the financial ruin of her late husband, gave her a certain amount of choice. In spite of everything she was a well-off widow, for whom finding a new partner must not have been very difficult. She looked for him not among the circles of her deceased husband, but decided to leave the region and settled in Steinbiedersdorf in the County of Crichingen, around 70 km northwest from Bouxweiler (belonging to the Holy Empire and not to France).

Sara Kassell apparently made a good match. By remarrying she not only increased her own wealth but also opened up business connections to her son, Bernhard, from her first marriage. Bernard Lipmann became a rich and important man. He married the daughter of the parnas of Crichingen and followed his stepfather as parnas of Steinbiedersdorf. In 1775 he was among the few Jewish houseowners of the community.

The marriage contract stipulated that Sara would receive her dowry back in the case that Abraham died. She would also get a portion of any property they might earn during their marriage (250 fl). Sara would also have a claim to all the gifts that Abraham had already given her or would give her in the future. In the case that Sara died first, her children from the first marriage would receive the larger potion of her dowry. Should Abraham and Sara have children of their own, these children would also receive a portion.

At first glance the contract seems to favor Abraham Jacob. There is almost no reference to his obligations, what he had to give. The contract aims to secure that Sara gets only a controlled portion of Abrahams’ property. This illuminates the risk that the property might fall into the hands of the wife or her relatives. Nothing is said what happens with Abrahams property after his death.

On closer inspection, however, Sara’s capacity to defend her own interests becomes visible. When Raphael Lipman died in 1750, an inventory of his property was made. Sara claimed her dowry with success. The creditors had no chance to get a part of this.

Sara was convinced that she could claim more (ehelicher Zugewinn), but she didn’t get it. That’s why she auctioned two places in the synagogue and a Hebrew book to get her money. She was sued for having embezzled property of her husband. But this had no effect. By moving from Bouxviller to Steinbiedersdorf and marrying Abraham Jacob she protected her dowry and the gain. Raphael’s creditors tried for more than 14 years to get their money back. Sara could benefit from her bad experience and make a better contract than in her first marriage, as suggested by her claim to all the gifts that Abraham gave her at any time.

The marriage contract between Sara Kassel and Abraham Jacob is an excellent example of the economic aspects of marriage and of the agency of women (widows and wifes) in early Modern Jewish society. In Jewish society dowry served as an important means to transfer of property. It was, perhaps, even more than in Christian society, because Jews had less immovable property. The goods acquired during marriages were often disputed. The discrimination against women in written laws was often balanced in practice by means of other, individual contracts.
