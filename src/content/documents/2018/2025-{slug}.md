description: This discussion explores the interactions between Jews and the
  natural world. The session focuses around Jewish engagement with rivers, and
  how waterways shaped the spatial dimensions of daily life. The discussion
  revolves around three sources from Central Europe that examine the ways in
  which thinking with rivers can lead us to explore not only the human-made
  spaces of a landscape, but also the natural elements at their outer limits.
  Each source sheds light on an aspect of the experience of environment and the
  role of space in Jewish life, and together offer a portrait of the place of
  water as a zone of physical and cultural interaction.
