description: >-
  Lope de Vera y Alarcón was an Old Christian Hebraist at the University of
  Salamanca in the late 1630s. In his professional training, he had access to
  texts that few people in Spain were permitted to see. His subversive reading
  of Erasmus and the Hebrew diary of David Reuveni, among other works, were not
  the only factors in his becoming a "judaizer," but by his own account they
  were of great importance. The texts I will present are excerpts from his
  Inquisition trial (1639-1644).
