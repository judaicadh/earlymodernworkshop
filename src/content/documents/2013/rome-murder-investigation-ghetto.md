<h2 style="text-align: center">Introduction</h2>

The story of Sabato del Corsetto tells about violence in the Roman ghetto in the second half of Sixteenth Century. It concerns many issues related to violence: family violence; verbal violence; physical violence; violence among women; violence arisen both for economic and personal reasons and even attempt made by the Jewish community to manage violence and violent people.

Criminal Sources in Early Modern Rome:

The story is developed by three different primary sources, all written by the offices of the Criminal Court of Papal Rome at the end of 1571 (august 1571 – February 1572). The first two concern two different trials while the last one comes from the register of Investigations made by the same Court. In Early Modern Justice, real trials were final steps of a longer proceeding beginning in various ways included anonymous denunciation and police investigation. People could be imprisoned and questioned about a crime out of a trial, in a preliminary phase called _Costituti_, which means “Questions on a crime”. Only some of these examinations resulted in judicial proceedings in a court: we have dozens of registers of _Costituti_ for any year and just few trials related to these. During the examination, questions were in Latin and answers in ancient Italian. Sentences represented another problem for the historians: even if all trials reached an end, just a few parts of these conclusions were recorded as single sentence. The most of them were just noted in registers of general administrative acts made by the same Offices (called _Registrazioni d’atti_), among many other issues, and it’s necessary to look carefully pages and pages to discover what happened to the indicted.

The trial against Sabato (1571): a violent Jewish Society

Sabato turned himself to the court on October 15, 1571 to clarify his non- involvement in the death of Rubbino Rossetto, an old rabbi, whose corpse was found in the ghetto, early in the morning on an unprecised day at the beginning of August 1571. Sabato was immediately suspected of the murder for two main reasons. On one hand, many witnesses attested he was involved in a violent quarrel just the night before and – as they said - it was possible that he deathly hit the old rabbi when he run furiously after another Jew, Sciolomon Siciliano. On the other hand, he was really unpopular and his enemies regarded to this brawl as an opportunity to take revenge on him. As he told to the court, in the last years he had argued with other Jews on job questions, which could be solved only thanks to some external interference. Sabato began to pick up dead horses as a certain Angelo Funaro previously did. So Angelo assaulted him and Sabato went to the Vicario to denounce Angelo. At the moment of this trial, Sabato and Angelo were partners in a company: this means that by anyway, probably after a private agreement ordered by Jewish arbiters, Angelo e Sabato were forced to put away their problems and work together. Of course, Angelo wasn’t happy of this solution.

During his examination, Sabato tried to depict himself as a good guy but his precedents didn’t help him to fulfill the task. Not only he had been imprisoned many times formerly but he had also disappeared for months at the beginning of this investigation. His narrative was centered on the representation of a victim: he had been ill, Jewish people are “sad” (bad people), he was poor, he had no enemies but a lot of people hate him (included the famous Jewish notary Pompeo del Borgo). Nonetheless, his violent attitude emerged from his own words and for this he attempted to dilute his behavior in a general violent contest, where a women brawl was usual as a job fight, a stabbing and threatening ?someone with a gun. There weren’t evidences against Sabato apart from the ghetto gossip. He confirmed his deposition even under torture and he was freed on October 30.

A Jewish gang: social and psychological violence in the ghetto

Just few months later, on February, Sabato was again in the same prison, this time to witness against a group of Jews. His own trial concerned physical violence while this second action reported on psychological and social violence. It was a case of bullying, where unconscious Jews used Christian institution to make money in prejudice of other Jews. If the murder investigation was the opportunity for some of elder Sabato’s enemies to punish him after job questions, this one was his occasion to get even. It was the custody of a young man, found in a neophyte’s home out of the ghetto during the night, to let the investigation begin. Suddenly the “birri” (policemen) revealed an incredible story where, in order to forgive gambling debts, a Jewish gang was used to steal stuff in the home of the wealthy people of the ghetto on Shabbat evening. As the examinations went on, it was clear that the gang was the author of a growing number of malefactions, included the one on which Sabato vouched that concerned a racket on false witnesses.

As this second trial attested, interlaced interests and networks crossed the ghetto and it was not easy to survive among these. Ancient aversions, rudeness, unfairness, fierce competition in a so limited job market were all element of daily life for Jewish people in Rome. They were used to crash against other Jews for a huge number of reasons. The judicial adventures of Sabato del Corsetto reveal how frequent were both those violent brawls and the consequent imprisonment. Just to speak on his past, Sabato was involved at least in four quarrels (that included a death, a stabbing and a gun shot) and he was captured four times (illegal trade, false witnesses etc....). It’s hard to live together, sharing little spaces and concurring for the same (few works). This condition was a perfect habitat for daily violence, as the story of Sabbato confirms.

Remaining Jews in Counter Reformation Rome

In Counter-Reformation Rome, there was an easy way to escape from this ugly condition and it was, of course, conversion to Christianity.  
It’s important to remember that both these trials could have ended with a baptism. Sabato stayed out of the ghetto for days after the discovery of Rubino’s corpse. The _birri_ looked for him in the Jewish quarter unsuccessfully until he decided to present to the judges. During all this time, he remained in Rome, probably in some Christian or neophyte’s home. He recalled this period during his examination as a proof of his innocence: «I told the truth and so God helped me because I didn’t sin; If I was guilty, I should flew away to Turkey or to some other places » \[_Io ho detto la verita et cosi Dio mi aiuto come non ho peccato et se io fossi stato me ne saria andato in Turchia o in qualche altro loco_\]. While Sabato thought to Ottoman Turkey as a safer place, it should be underlined that he never referred to the House of Catechumens, which represented a closer and easier solution to all his problems. The same was for the Jews of the gang, despite their dangerous connections with neophytes. The leaders were sentenced to exile and nobody choose to convert even in this case.

The story of Sabato offers two clues to reflect on the Roman Jews resistance to conversion. As he said, his job quarrel with Angelo Funaro (against whom he vouched in the second trial) was resolved in the ghetto: «Now I’m in their company for the next two years and we have to be in company». This short sentence means that the two parts came to an agreement after the denunciation to the Vicario and that this agreement was signed inside the Jewish society (otherwise Sabato should have told to the judges the name of the Christian notary that wrote the act as usual in such cases). They weren’t friends but they had to keep calm and the Jewish institutions worked to establish a kind of peace inside the ghetto.

The memorandum of the discovery of money in Rubino’s home tells something more on this politic. It was written few days after the death, while Sabato was lost out of the ghetto and police was still investigating on the murder. The note doesn’t mention these topics. It concerns tension between the representatives of _Gemilut Hasadim_ and Rubino’s heirs, at the beginning on the possibility to find something in the home, than on the right division of the treasure. At least, it refers to the way to diffuse this tension, entrusting the management of the money to an important Jewish banker as Angelo di Capua and informing Christian authority about the fact only after its peaceful solution.

Roman society was violent and Jews were as violent as Christians. Brawls blew up frequently and involved Jews both in contrast with other Jews and against Christians. We had many _Costituti_ on fights in Roman market places were some Jews played a role, but this isn’t our point. Violence inside the ghetto walls was more dangerous for the Jewish community that the other one, just under the eye of Christian Courts. Jewish society tried to govern itself despite its inner violence, using any tool to run the people of the ghetto, from internal agreement to the clever use of Christian juridical system. Sometimes it succeeded, sometimes it failed but it’s important to investigate the ways they used to manage themselves in the long ghetto era.

_In the Court of the Most Reverend Governor of Rome  
Trial for alleged murder in Rome against the Jew Sabato son of Angelo del Corsetto. Master Johannes Paulus Majnus, chancellor and notary_

_In God’s Name, Amen. October 15, 1571_

_Interrogated in person in Rome in Tor di Nona \[the municipal\] prison, in the court of His Excellency Master Bernardino Coto lieutenant and magistrate, and in my presence mister Vincentio Berti substitute._

_Sabato son of Angelo de Piperno Jew, to whom I administered the oath to tell the truth. He gave his oath before me “tacto calamo,” that is, in the Jewish manner._

_Questioned about how he came to the prison, whether he was arrested or came of his own will.  
He answered:_ I’m here in prison and I presented myself spontaneously because someone told me that one of the nephews (I don’t remember his name) of Rubino Roscietto accused me of his death; I wanted to come earlier but I was ill.

_Questioned about the reason for which, according to him, he has been charged about the deceased Rubino Roscetto.  
He answered:_ It was more or less two months ago that one evening – at nearly the 24th hour of the night – my wife told me that my sister Chiara had been dragged by her hair by the sister of the wife of Sciolomon, whose father was Sicilian. When I arrived, I knew that my sister went to the court to report this scuffle and when I entered, I said aloud: “May my sister be killed \[if she\] should not be dragged by her hair!” Just at that moment Sciolomon walked by and said “Be careful! My sister-in-law isn’t a woman to be taken by hair!” I replied: “Nor is my sister such a woman!” And so he said: “ Shut up!” One word led to another and Sciolomon hit me on my shoulder and escaped and so I ran after him, but my wife stopped me. It was said that I had bumped into Rubbino Roscetto as I ran after Sciolomon, but I could not reach him! In the middle of the street I punched my wife who was trying to stop me, and this made a little blood come out of her mouth, and then I told her to be quiet. I think that's why people think I hit Rubin Roscietti.

_Questioned as to whether he carried any weapon as he ran after Sciolomon. He answered:_ That evening as I ran after Salomon I had no weapon of any sort; neither stones nor sticks. I did not think of carrying weapons and I had only a fruit that I was eating at the moment.

_Questioned as to whether he knew the said Rubino Roscietto, and how.  
He answered:_ Of course, I knew Rubino Roscietto who was old and went around teaching the little kids.  
_Questioned about the place were he stopped running after Solomon and on whether he knew where Rubino Roscietto had been injured.  
He answered:_ That evening I ran after Solomon until Moise Pellegrino’s home, where my wife grabbed me; I threw her on the ground, I hit her and some women picked her up. Then I went home. I understood that someone had bumped into Rubin Roscietto next to the river gates.  
_Questioned about his dinner on that evening with his wife.  
He answered:_ That evening – when my wife stopped me – I came back home for dinner and I slept there.  
_Questioned as to whether he ate alone or with others that night, and with whom.  
He answered:_ That evening I dined with my father, my sister and my wife. _Questioned whether he learned that night what happened to Rubino Rossetto.  
He answered:_ The \[next\] morning after I heard that Rubino Roscetto was dead I was waiting at the gate to Piazza Giudea to go with some other fellows to collect dead animals around Rome; while I was waiting someone advised me to run away because the police were at my house. Even my father told me to go away for some days, so I did for the next eight days. Then I fell ill with a fever, toothache and _zincone._ During that period I was here and there and did the best I could, but I was never out of Rome.

_Questioned why he did not Sciolomon again after he threw his wife to the ground.  
He answered:_ Solomon was as far away as twice this room (_and he indicates the visiting room of the prison_); he ran as fast as a goat; so, I did not catch him again and I went to my home.

_Questioned where he began to run after Solomon and how far this place was from the other where he claims his wife stopped him.  
He answered:_ That evening I started to run from my home until, as I said, that of Moise son of Pellegrino. That is more or less twice \[the size\] of this room from my house.

_Questioned about how far the place where he claims he was held by his wife to the spot where he understood the late Rubino Rosetto died)_.  
_He answered:_ The distance between the place where my wife stopped me that night and the other where Rubino Rosetto felt down was nearly twice this room.

_Questioned if he knew or heard that there was a murder investigation into Rubino Rossetto’s death.  
He answered:_ I don’t know and I didn’t hear that witnesses have been interrogated on this death.

_Questioned if he had any enemy and who they are.  
He answered:_ As far as I know I have neither enemies nor ill-wishers. Once I was arrested, and the court interrogated me about whether I traveled to Florence and I paid 4 scudi; another time – maybe 15 days before Rubino Roscetto’s death – I was arrested again by magister Valerio, who asked me if I knew a tailor and I answered that I didn’t; eight or nine years ago, I was arrested by Your Lordship together with my father and my brother-in-law to be questioned about some wheat that somebody said we bought.  
_Questioned if he knew Pompeo del Borgo and why.  
He answered:_ Of course, I know Pompeo the Jew for a long time, because I know all the Jews.  
_Questioned if he knows that some Jews were arrested for Rubino Rosetto’s death and who they are.  
He answered:_ My father told me that some men and women were arrested for Rubin Roscetto’s death but he didn’t tell me who.  
_Questioned if Pompeo the Jews was a friend of his and what opinion he held and holds of him.  
He answered:_ When I was arrested eight or nine years ago by Your Lordship, he interrogated me and had me jailed because he is relative of a certain Angelo – who was incarcerated for the same wheat. I’ve nothing to do with him, and I reported about Pompeo the truth of what he did.

_Asked to explain what opinion he held and holds of Pompeo, and whether he considers him a man of bad or good condition and reputation.  
He answered:_ I think that all the Jews are sad people, with the exception of my father but it’s not for me to say this.

_Questioned if he was used to carrying any kind of weapon (iron, lead or marble)  
He answered:_ If you discover that I carry any cudgel (lead or marble), you must punish me more than I deserve.

_Questioned if he knew that the deceased Rubino Roscietto was injured when he died and in which part of the body and by whom.  
He answered_: I don’t know and I never knew that Rubin Roscietto had any injury when he died.

_Questioned where Rubino Rossetto’s death was caused.  
He answered:_ I don’t know and I never knew what caused his death; I heard that Robin Roscetti it was two or three hours till he died, that he was found on the ground next to the river gate.

_c. 426 r.  
October, 19th 1571_

_Interrogated in person in Tor di Nona, Rome’s municipal prison, in the court of His Excellence Master Bernardino Coto lieutenant and magistrate and in my presence, Master Vincentio Berti substitute._

_Sabato son of Angelo del Corsetto Jew, as above, to whom I administered the oath to tell the truth. He gave his oath before me “tacto calamo,” that is, in the Jewish manner._

_Asked if he wanted to say something more on what he had said in his previous deposition.  
He answered:_ No, I don’t need to say anything else because what I said in my previous deposition was totally correct.

_Questioned if in the past he had a row with other Jews during which he could have injured someone or be injured by someone else.  
He answered:_ it is possible that I had a quarrel with other Jews but now I do not remember, except maybe something happened when I was very young. _Questioned if he knew Angelo son of Giuseppe Funari and when and why they dealt together._

_He answered:_ Of course, I know Angelo Funaro and I dealt with him. It was about four or five months ago and I was standing at the door to my house, maybe at one in the night, and he suddenly assaulted me with a pistol, he hit me, I didn’t escape but I tried to save myself and I was secretly hidden when he searched that room (_and he indicates the visiting room)_; than he was saved in the house of Zozo, another Jew, next to the gate.

_Questioned why Angelo Funaro assaulted him with that gun.  
He answered:_ He assaulted me because I began to engage in the same profession as he – that is with animal corpses. Until that time, he was the only one who did that; he wanted to buy the animals for nothing.  
Once I undertook the same business he thought he wouldn’t be able to get the animals for that price as he wished. For this reason, he began to hunt me down and say that he wanted to kill me or beat me because he and his fellows were four people, all ready to chase me. So, I went by the Vicar to accuse them, they were questioned and shortly after he assaulted me. Prior to those events, I had never had anything to deal with him, except for this job and now I’m in their company for the next two years and we have to be in company.  
_Questioned if he drew a gun against Angelo in order to beat him with that weapon.  
He answered:_ You’ll never find that I draw a gun against someone. _Questioned if he said the truth concerning Rubino the Jew.  
He answered:_ I did tell \[the truth\] and I maintain what I said for the next 100 years. The truth is that I did not run up to the place where he fell down and I did not otherwise see him on the ground.

\[_The next days, the court questioned some other people, including the Jewish notary Pompeo Del Borgo_\]
