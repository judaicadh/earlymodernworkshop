**Freisinger Rechtsbuch, article 41 and 42 (around 1328)**

41\. Concerning the Jews it is established that you cannot convict them except when with \[the testimony of\] Jews and Christians. If a Jew kills a Christian and this is seen only by Christians and Jews were not present, could the Jews be found guilty of manslaughter only with Christians \[as witnesses\]? We say: yes. But if the Jew can prove self-defence, he should be free, but he should prove this with Christians and not Jews.

42\. But if it happens that a Christian kills a Jew, should he make amends? We think so, because the Jews have special rights and live in the cities under princely protection. For this reason, the Christian must make reparation to them, as we have already stated concerning the murder, and even more so, because it is the power of the princes to demand a greater penance, as if such person had killed a Christian, namely because he has broken the princely peace in regard to Jews. We say: If a Christian has done therefore, how should one judge him? Yes, we think you should judge him as if he had killed a Christian. Furthermore, the judge should accuse him, and not the Jews, even if he (the victim) has relatives.

On injuring and pulling hair of a Jew by a Christian XII

In addition, if a Jew and a Christian have together a dispute between themselves, and if the Christian injures the Jew causing a bloody or livid wound, or slaps him, or pulls out hair from his head, then we are providing Jews with our jurisdiction, so that the aforementioned wounded Jew, can take the oath according to their custom, in such a way that the Jew does it over knocker (_feruncam_), or (_alias_) _na kolcze_, at the door of their synagogue. Then the Christian, if proven guilty by the Jewish oath, shall be liable to pay him 5 marks for the slapping and ten marks for a livid wound, however for the bloody wound he will give to the Jew half of his property, whether movable and immovable, but the remaining half of these goods are reserved for us and our successors, and the Palatine of the relevant district. And other crimes will be adjudicated according to our will, but for pulling the hair from the head of a Jew, Christians will need to pay indemnity according to the decree of the lords, residing in this court, according to the law.

On the capital punishment for killing a Jew XIII

Furthermore, if, God forbid, Christian kills one of the Jews, and then the kinsman of the killed Jew proves the Christian guilty by taking an oath over _rodale_ (Torah scroll) according to the Jewish custom, then we decide and establish, that such Jew must be given compensation by the Christian, valued at life for life, and this cannot be done differently.

On the fugitive killer of the Jew XIV

If however such Christian, who killed a Jew, in some way escaped, and he cannot be captured or held, then the his movable and immovable property, whichever he has, \[is confiscated\]: one half of the aforementioned goods and real estate should be given to the blood relatives of the murdered Jew, another half will belong to our royal chancellery.

On _salvus conductum_ for the killer of the Jew XV

If however the fugitive killer of the Jew would wish to obtain salvus conductum, this cannot be given without the agreement of the blood relatives of the murdered Jew.

On Christians’ wounds XXVI

Also, if any Christian happens to show wounds, whatever they may be, inflicted on him by the Jew, he should then present them to their Szkolnik and also usher. And this cannot by judged by the judge in the court located elsewhere, but with their Szkolnik, or even in a place that the Jews with their judge from different parts choose or define. And if the Christian brings two Jewish and two Christian \[witnesses who confirm\] that the Christian was inflicted wounds by the Jew, then this Jew must pay him according to the custom of the land.

Court case from the archbishopric consistorial court of the Lwow’s

A discreet Franciscan monk John, native of Trembowla, proposes against perfidious Jew Jacob of Busk, son of Moses, currently remaining in Gologory, that once, on a third day after St. Jacob’s festival of the current year around second hour of that night, the aforementioned Jew, either led by the evil spirit, or presumably by his Devil, being the enemy of Christ, he wounded this priest John gravely on his face, inflicted a mortal wound, and prostrated him to the ground. And John estimates the enormous and deadly injury and the loss of blood at 1000 florins of pure gold and just weight, and decides, that after he suffered and bore the aforementioned enormous wound and loss of blood from the abovementioned Jew Jacob, and still suffers and bears it, to asks the court to compel the perfidious Jew Jacob to pay the compensation, and nonetheless to declare the sentence of excommunication against the Jew as indicated by the canon law. In the presence of the plaintiff, the aforementioned Jew negated the story and facts. And the priest presented the sworn witnesses concerning this beating.

Interrogation was conducted of Łukasz Orsula in the case of a murdered Jew during which Orsula, questioned concerning his reasons for killing this Jew, responded: I had no reason, it was only because Pirdzel’s son came to me with another Strozyk. I was napping around noon, since I was drunk, and they came to me saying that their father told them about the approaching Jew who has the money, and that he should be killed. And so we followed him. I captured him, and Strozyk grabbed a stick. He was beating this Jew. I only held him, but I would have never done it, had not old Pirdzel ordered his boys to come to me. Then when asked, what they did with the money \[they stole\], he responded: We gave the boys, Pirdziel and Strozyk’s brother 1 zloty to each, and the rest we split between ourselves with Strozyk. The cloths however weren’t good and I buried them.

\[...\]

The court (jointly held by the mayor, jurors and aldermen) published the following decree in regard to this crime and evil deed done the innocent that committed by Łukasz Orsula. First, that the aforementioned plaintiff and instigator Marek Czapnik submitted a petition against the accused criminal Łukasz Orsula from the village of Rzezawa for killing his son-in-law, and he asked this court for sacred justice, and \[Łukasz Orsula\] during the second and third questioning freely admitted that he, together with his accomplices, murdered the Jews, however he denied that he personally beat \[this Jew\], but only captured him and squeezed, but Struzyk killed him with the stick. The court questioned him in order to acquire a greater truth, and he admitted to stealing \[from this Jew\] when the murder was committed. And the court, looking into this case and taking into consideration that the aforementioned Ursula did not mind the divine commandment, severity and acuity of the law concerning killing the Jews, as the Lord God in his sacred commandment prohibited killing, and

also suffered for both a Jew and a Catholic, \[decided\] that the aforementioned Ursula deserves harsh and severe punishment also for stealing, but since there is no plaintiff pursuing the crime of robbery, thus \[we issue this sentence\] for the other crime of killing a Jew, so that the others would be also sconced and that the crime would not go unpunished, and thus he is sentenced to death by decapitation near the statute of Passion outside of the town.

De vulneracione et capilacione Iudei per Cristianum XII

Insuper si Cristianus cum Iudeo contenderit insimul quovismodo et si idem Cristianus Iudeum vulneraverit vulnere cruentato aut livido, aut sibi maxillam inflixerit, vel crines de capite extraxerit, sive eruerit, tune nos damus sibi Iudeo talem iurisdictionem nostram, quod prefatus Iudeus taliter vulneratus, prefato iuramento secundum consuetudinem ipsorum, super feruncam, alias na kolcze, ipsorum Iudeorum scole hostii iurare debet, tunc talis Cristianus, si per Iudeum superiuratus fuerit, debebitet tenebitur eidem pro maxilla a quolibet digito quinque marcas et a vulnere livido decem marcas, a vulnere vero cruentato medietatem suorum bonorum tam mobilium quam et immobilium Iudeo predicto, residuam vero medietatem ipsorum bonorum pro nobis et successoribus nostris et pro palatinis huiusmodi districtus reservamus, et alias iuxta nostram voluntatem iudicabimus premissa, sed pro crinibus de capite Iudei extractis Cristianus prefatus sibi Iudeo solvere tenebitur secundum decretum dominorum, in eodem iudicio residencium, iuxta posicionem iuris.

De pena capitali Iudei occisi XIII.

Ceterum, quod absit, si aliquis Cristianus aliquem ex Iudeis occiderit, extunc proximior Iudeus Iudei occisi, si Cristianum super rodale decem preceptorum superiuraverit secundum tenorem Iudeorum, tunc volumus et statuimus, quod talis Iudeus ipsum Cristianum superiuratum mortificare debet, taxando pro capite caput; et hoc aliter non sit faciendum.

De occisore Iudaico aufugiente XIV.

Si vero talis Cristianus, qui occiderit Iudeum, aliquo modo aufugerit, ita, quod non possit capi, nec in manibus haberi, extunc ipsius bona eiusdem Cristiani tam mobilia, quam et immobilia, quecunque habuerit, primo medietas dictorum bonorum et hereditatum debet devoivi super proximiores consanguineos Iudei interempti, reliqua vero medietas pro cancellaria nostra regia debet pertineri.

De salvo conductu Iudaici occisoris XV.

Item si talis profugus Iudei interempti salvum conductum habere voluerit, dari sibi non debet, nisi cum consensu dictorum consanguineorum ipsius Iudei interempti.

De protestacione vulnerum Cristianorum XXVI.

Item si aliquem Cristianum contingent publicare vulnera, quecunque sint, per Iudeum sibi data, tunc debet, ea monstrare Scolnemu ipsorum Iudeorum et eciam ministeriali, et ipse iudex non debet iudicare nec iudicium locare in causa tali alibi, nisi circa Scolny ipsorum, aut eciam ubi dicti Iudei cum iudice ipsorum ex utraque parte consencient et locum aptum cum ipsis elegerint, seu deputaverint, et ibidem si adducet Cristianus duobus Iudeis et duobus Cristianis, quod sibi idem Iudeus eadem vulnera dedit et intulit, extunc idem Iudeus sibi solvere debet eadem, iuxta consuetudinem terrestrem.

Court case from the Lwów castle court

Prussy. Industrious Jacob from the royal village Prussy proposed against perfidious Jew Filimon, that he killed his brother Matthew de Prussy who was resting on the royal land and on the free road, and he therefore brings the (case of) deceased Matthew to the court. Filiomon responded through his attorney nobleman John Kampkam that neither he committed this crime, nor killed Matthew, nor knew anything about the aforementioned homicide. Jacob said: I am ready to take an oath to Jew Filemon on my brother’s life. And standing he declared himself guilty of the murder and asked for mercy alias _dal szye na miloscz_. We, seating in court, decree that Jacob should receive 10 marks which he sought for the life of his brother Matthew from Jew Filimon, and further the same Jew should already be condemned concerning this violence by this recognition and proposal, since he asked himself for mercy for the murder. This case is transferred to Lord Palatine after his taking of office in Leopolis in one week.
