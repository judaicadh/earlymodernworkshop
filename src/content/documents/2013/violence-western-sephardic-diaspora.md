  Recurrent private acts of violence within dense and homogenous communities, or
  diasporas, illustrate a tension between powerful gossip transmission and
  imperfect translation of such power into efficient social control.


  This presentation explores the manifestation of private violence in the daily
  life of the Western Sephardic Diaspora in the early seventeenth century,
  examining inquisitorial sources from Portugal and notarial records from the
  Netherlands. These sources indicate that as much as group members expected
  mutual responsibility, trustworthiness and compliance with social norms from
  their fellow group members. Yet when they felt disappointed, they expressed
  their resentment aggressively. Aggression took shape of offenses and beating
  with hands, sticks and various other objects, including cold steel. The body
  of sources suggests that the Western Sephardic Diaspora involved a
  significantly fervid environment.

<h2 style="text-align: center">Introduction</h2>

Studies in social network analysis, anthropology and new institutional economics predict that the attributes of the Western Sephardic Diaspora in the turn of the seventeenth century would make its members highly susceptible to gossip. The diaspora’s social network comprised a high proportion of lasting and strong ties, and involved frequent and significant interactions among many of their members. The latter shared a relative consensus about what constituted proper behavior in trade, gambling, sex life and decorum. Hence, information about misbehavior flowed rapidly and intensely within the group.

Such attributes supported informal collective action in the form of social and economic estrangement, and ridicule. The same attributes also facilitated verification and sanction by the judicial system. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of both private and official mechanisms was imperfect. Group members married, socialized and conducted sensitive and sizeable transactions mostly among themselves. In Amsterdam, group members also resorted to the newly founded community institutions and its establishment for political protection and economic aid. However, Western Sephardic Jews and New Christians did not rely exclusively on each other for social and economic relations. The actuality of such outside options diminished the deterring power of collection action. Both official and informal mechanisms were not only imperfect but also costly. Judicial proceedings consumed time and money, whereas the social entanglement of the diaspora was precisely what made collective action costly to the same individuals who inflicted it.

The effectiveness of gossip alongside the imperfection of the social control mechanisms made those who felt either abused or liable to undeserved sanction more irritable and, therefore, more prone to turn to violence.

Aggression was usually followed by reconciliation or at least mollification, to which official sanction and social pressure had a critical role. Yet retaliation against family members, in fact, facilitated appeasement and compromise by increasing the costs of extending conflict and, therefore, intensifying one’s family social pressure to compromise. Yet retaliation against family members, in fact, facilitated appeasement and compromise by increasing the costs of extending conflict and, therefore, intensifying one’s family social pressure to compromise. The role of family in securing stability present significant commonalities with the model of “community responsibility mechanism” described by Avner Greif and others for securing transactions among multinational traders in medieval fairs.

Collectively the group perceived such outbursts of private violence as internally disruptive and externally undermining the group status within the broader society. Between individuals and the group, family emerged as a central institution. Relatives were expected to automatically take the side of their offended kin. Hence, the enmity of a family member was extensive to one’s relatives as well.

Most research about New Christians’ lives deriving from inquisitorial files tends to focus on the denunciations and confessions sections of the trial files, and overlook the culprit’s defense. In fact, when it occurs, the defense section is one of the richest materials provided by these sources. In such defenses, culprits who did not confess right away strove to discredit those whom they assumed were their denouncers. Defendants did not know the identity of their denouncers, only the place and time in which the “crimes” purportedly took place. In addition, the lists of charges presented to defendants purposely broke up each accusation into several in order to convey the impression that defendants had a much larger number of denouncers than they actually had.

Defense strategy basically consisted of claiming that all those who the defendants suspected to have denounced them hated them deadly and, therefore, would falsely accuse them before the inquisitors. If a defendant succeeded to impeach all, or nearly all, of his actual denouncers, he or she might either be absolved or given the lesser charge of suspicion of heresy. In the first case, the defendant would not be punished and would retrieve all his property that had been seized upon imprisonment, except for trial costs. In the latter case, he or she would recover a portion of the property and would receive a mild penalty, leaving the person’s reputation less tainted within a society in which purity of faith and blood came to play an increasingly significant role in establishing one’s status.

Such defense strategies, however, had consequential shortcomings. From the Inquisition’s cell, the defendant had to be able to identify those who actually accused him, supposedly in secret. For that purpose, culprits typically listed all possible accusers in the impeachment (contradiction) articles, recounting the reasons for becoming an object of hatred and designating witnesses thereof. The inquisitors assigned commissioners to investigate the witnesses on those articles in which the defendant succeeded to make reference to an actual accuser. Investigations, which often took place in localities other than the Inquisition headquarters, cost money. Hence, not every culprit could afford this expedient. Furthermore, such procedures also took time, and were conducted at the discretion of the inquisitors. Finally, the inquisitors were to judge whether hatred prevailed between the accuser and the culprit. As a result, defense was effective when the number of accusers was small and the culprit was able to convince the inquisitor to consider that animosity might indeed have prevailed between the parties.

Then as now, it is very hard to establish whether one hates someone else. Inquisitors tended to give greater credit to claims that comprised descriptions of violence. Consequently, private violence emerged as a juridical category that provided a clearer indication of animosity to inform a lawsuit. Furthermore, inquisitors accepted evidence of hate between the culprit and denouncers’ family members, as if there was a transitive property of hatred within the family: the enemy of one’s uncle is also the enemy of the nephew/niece and so forth.

The corpus of inquisitorial files examined comprises those initiated by the sweeping wave of imprisonments cautiously directed against New Christian merchants resident in Porto between 1618 and 1621. Amid them, the case of Manuel Rodrigues dos Santos is emblematic. He managed to escape to Madrid, and with the help of other Portuguese New Christians in Spain, he embarked in slave trafficking journey to Africa. Recognized and denounced along the way, he was arrested in Angola and brought to the Inquisition in Lisbon at the end of 1622.

By the time of his imprisonment, Santos had only two accusers. A third person denounced him while he was already in prison. This was a considerably small number of accusers vis-à-vis his fellow townsmen imprisoned shortly before him. Santos denied all accusations against him and presented long lists of impeachment articles. The first list contained 81 articles.

He succeeded to make a point that two of his accusers disliked him. He also made a case that the husband, uncle, brother and brother-in-law of the final denouncer hated him too. He also claimed that this last denouncer’s accusations were false, because he was not in Porto but in Madrid at the time of the “crime” informed by the Inquisition’s prosecutor to the culprit and his lawyer.

After more than four years in prison and a torture session, Santos was pronounced suspect of heresy and convicted to a year of banishment in the hinterland village of Évora Monte. Culprits who remained either “negative,” i.e., denied all charges, or “diminutes,” those who did not confess a number of charges, were submitted to torture. Undergoing torture without confession was a delicate tactic. It could be a sign of either innocence, if there were few and not very grounded charges, or of pertinacity in one’s heresy. The former could lead to absolution or a mild penalty, whereas the latter lead to capital punishment. Santos’ sentence was a significantly mild one in both concrete and symbolic dimensions, compared to most cases deriving from the imprisonments in Porto around 1618– 1621.

It is true that Santos late imprisonment allowed him to prepare his defense better. He could know which fellow countrymen had already been imprisoned or freed, and most probably he was able to collect details about their confessions too. As a rule, accusations derived from confessions, which were the only other alternative for those who were unable to make a solid defense and undergo torture, and wished to avoid capital punishment. Confessing having had accomplices who were not yet imprisoned was a sign of the culprit’s sincerity in the eyes of the Inquisition.

Santos’ defense was successful because he was able to make a case that he had fierce disputes with his accusers, their families and, not least important, with various members of the New Christian group in Porto, many of which ostensibly culminated in violent outbursts. As result, his claims that he was not very well liked among the pool of potential Judaizers, and not only those who directly denounced with as a heretic, were more credible.

The origins of alleged animosity varied. It included business differences and competition, gambling, bullying, scandals about one’s sex life (adultery, prostitution, impotence), etc. Most cases convey the perpetrator’s narrative. All quarrels happened partially in public spaces and supposedly had witnesses. In one of the cases, a judged stepped in to halt violence with official sanction. Offenses to the father and uncle were claimed to be, and accepted as being, extensive to the defendant, as well as the offenses by the defendant were extensive to the offended family members. The same is true about family members of third parties who became involved in such quarrels. The participation of servants and slaves might have also been comprised within the scope of such “transitive property” of enmity. Moreover, assaults committed by servants and slaves certainly added to the narrative of public humiliation.

Even if the number of disputes with violent outcomes is higher in Santos’ file, and he might have been more of an aggressive character, such conduct was not significantly different from those recounted in other files of his fellow countrymen.

Santos also mentioned a number of aggressions perpetrated by non-group members. A civic officer committed one of them, allegedly under the influence of the defendant. The other was perpetrated by a butcher, and was included in the defense in order to make a case that the impeached parties were indeed defamed residents of the city. In fact, those brothers appeared to have some mental illness, as several culprits and the inquisitors themselves attest, although their father was a prominent jurist and one of the brothers attended the University of Coimbra. Only a few of these claims were investigated, when they referred to those who had actually accused the defendant.

A judicious researcher tends to look at these claims warily, particularly to its violent aspects. Defendants may have added such aggressive culmination to the incidents in order to magnify the severity of the dispute, and make a case before their adjudicators.

Witnesses confirmed that there was a kernel of truth on the accounts, but expressed reservations as to the accuracy of their details. In one case, the witness stated that he did not know “whether these were verbal or included knife strikes.” He claimed not having been present to the scene and having heard about it at the house of a New Christians, who according to him fled to Castile and died there. However, Amsterdam notarial records reveal that this runaway in fact escaped to Amsterdam. Hence, the reader may also doubt the veracity of the witnesses, whose testimonies most often were somewhat vague, as witnesses did not want to clearly side with either version. In the second case, the witnesses confirmed the quarrels around the auction and the beating with sticks by the public officers. However, they did not mention stabbing and, moreover, one of them did not recalled the impeached party ever being at the scene.

Even if many of these accounts were exaggerated, it does not mean that they were all entirely imaginary. In fact, notarial deeds from Amsterdam record a number of cases that resemble closely the accounts made in inquisitorial files. These cases involved recent émigrés of Jewish origin from Portugal. Were these manifestations of violence mere coincidences, calculated exaggerations or deep rooted social practices?

Much has been written about the ferment and fervent discords within the Amsterdam Sephardic community. However, most studies refer to such disputes around the community’s framework, establishment and authority, or with regard to Amsterdam Sephardim’s identity as a group. Less attention has been paid to the private acrimonious quarrels among its members, and to their social constraints and effects.

The affidavits about the brawl between Jacob Montesinos and the Veiga brothers point to striking similarity in both content – motivations, expression of anger, manifestations of violence, etc. – and style, in which such disputes were narrated. Both this and other cases of interpersonal violence among Sephardic Jews in Amsterdam underline both the assumption and actuality of the transitive property of animosity.

Montesinos and the Veigas had business dealings, many common friends and dwelled, at least temporarily, in the same building. The latter were accused of bankruptcy fraud and embezzlement, or at least incompetence as agents. They were also blamed for being harmfully and aggressively inclined. Their sisters were said to be public prostitutes in the Southern Low Countries.

The affidavits were testimonies about the good reputation of the Veiga brothers, who were in prison for their debt at that time. The quarrels involved swords and knives, and promise to kill enemies through relatives. Vows to “bring all harm one could” on an adversary were either not as formulaic as Inquisition sources might suggest or were a topos in conflicts at the time. Sexual defamation was an important way to bring harm to an opponent, as well as other insults such as the “many other affronting words against the arrested parties and their sisters, which were very bad and scandalous, and are inappropriate to be brought before this Senate \[City Council or Court\].”

Family members were implicated in the squabbles and servants took part in it. Both this and other cases of private violence underline both the assumption and actuality of the transitive property of animosity. The involvement of authorities, such as those who imprisoned the Veigas, entailed greater offense. Third parties intervened in order to bring the opponents apart, and group members censured the aggressor, saying “that it was wrong to want to kill a man in that way,” meaning tied up. Moreover, a group member reminded him the consequences that such form of dispute could bring upon the group in general. He would have said to Montesinos “why he did so, why he made two honored men be arrested, and that he dishonored the \[Portuguese Jewish\] nation so.” In other cases, authorities also stepped in to halt altercations.

Both in Amsterdam and in Porto, those involved in these brawls were far from being marginal elements of the Western Sephardic Diaspora. Sources’ bias makes it difficult to establish what was the extent or the actual severity of these aggressive disputes. However, it is clear that some level of aggression was frequent.

The instances in which aggression occurred suggest that it was a reaction to the power of gossip and to gossip’s limits in securing social control through either collective action or official sanction. Gossip could bring much social and economic damage but not efficient social control.
