  Recurrent private acts of violence within dense and homogenous communities, or
  diasporas, illustrate a tension between powerful gossip transmission and
  imperfect translation of such power into efficient social control.


  This presentation explores the manifestation of private violence in the daily
  life of the Western Sephardic Diaspora in the early seventeenth century,
  examining inquisitorial sources from Portugal and notarial records from the
  Netherlands. These sources indicate that as much as group members expected
  mutual responsibility, trustworthiness and compliance with social norms from
  their fellow group members. Yet when they felt disappointed, they expressed
  their resentment aggressively. Aggression took shape of offenses and beating
  with hands, sticks and various other objects, including cold steel. The body
  of sources suggests that the Western Sephardic Diaspora involved a
  significantly fervid environment.

<h2 style="text-align: center">Introduction</h2>

Studies in social network analysis, anthropology and new institutional economics predict that the attributes of the Western Sephardic Diaspora in the turn of the seventeenth century would make its members highly susceptible to gossip. The diaspora’s social network comprised a high proportion of lasting and strong ties, and involved frequent and significant interactions among many of their members. The latter shared a relative consensus about what constituted proper behavior in trade, gambling, sex life and decorum. Hence, information about misbehavior flowed rapidly and intensely within the group.

Such attributes supported informal collective action in the form of social and economic estrangement, and ridicule. The same attributes also facilitated verification and sanction by the judicial system. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of both private and official mechanisms was imperfect. Group members married, socialized and conducted sensitive and sizeable transactions mostly among themselves. In Amsterdam, group members also resorted to the newly founded community institutions and its establishment for political protection and economic aid. However, Western Sephardic Jews and New Christians did not rely exclusively on each other for social and economic relations. The actuality of such outside options diminished the deterring power of collection action. Both official and informal mechanisms were not only imperfect but also costly. Judicial proceedings consumed time and money, whereas the social entanglement of the diaspora was precisely what made collective action costly to the same individuals who inflicted it.

The effectiveness of gossip alongside the imperfection of the social control mechanisms made those who felt either abused or liable to undeserved sanction more irritable and, therefore, more prone to turn to violence.

Aggression was usually followed by reconciliation or at least mollification, to which official sanction and social pressure had a critical role. Yet retaliation against family members, in fact, facilitated appeasement and compromise by increasing the costs of extending conflict and, therefore, intensifying one’s family social pressure to compromise. Yet retaliation against family members, in fact, facilitated appeasement and compromise by increasing the costs of extending conflict and, therefore, intensifying one’s family social pressure to compromise. The role of family in securing stability present significant commonalities with the model of “community responsibility mechanism” described by Avner Greif and others for securing transactions among multinational traders in medieval fairs.

Collectively the group perceived such outbursts of private violence as internally disruptive and externally undermining the group status within the broader society. Between individuals and the group, family emerged as a central institution. Relatives were expected to automatically take the side of their offended kin. Hence, the enmity of a family member was extensive to one’s relatives as well.

Most research about New Christians’ lives deriving from inquisitorial files tends to focus on the denunciations and confessions sections of the trial files, and overlook the culprit’s defense. In fact, when it occurs, the defense section is one of the richest materials provided by these sources. In such defenses, culprits who did not confess right away strove to discredit those whom they assumed were their denouncers. Defendants did not know the identity of their denouncers, only the place and time in which the “crimes” purportedly took place. In addition, the lists of charges presented to defendants purposely broke up each accusation into several in order to convey the impression that defendants had a much larger number of denouncers than they actually had.

Defense strategy basically consisted of claiming that all those who the defendants suspected to have denounced them hated them deadly and, therefore, would falsely accuse them before the inquisitors. If a defendant succeeded to impeach all, or nearly all, of his actual denouncers, he or she might either be absolved or given the lesser charge of suspicion of heresy. In the first case, the defendant would not be punished and would retrieve all his property that had been seized upon imprisonment, except for trial costs. In the latter case, he or she would recover a portion of the property and would receive a mild penalty, leaving the person’s reputation less tainted within a society in which purity of faith and blood came to play an increasingly significant role in establishing one’s status.

Such defense strategies, however, had consequential shortcomings. From the Inquisition’s cell, the defendant had to be able to identify those who actually accused him, supposedly in secret. For that purpose, culprits typically listed all possible accusers in the impeachment (contradiction) articles, recounting the reasons for becoming an object of hatred and designating witnesses thereof. The inquisitors assigned commissioners to investigate the witnesses on those articles in which the defendant succeeded to make reference to an actual accuser. Investigations, which often took place in localities other than the Inquisition headquarters, cost money. Hence, not every culprit could afford this expedient. Furthermore, such procedures also took time, and were conducted at the discretion of the inquisitors. Finally, the inquisitors were to judge whether hatred prevailed between the accuser and the culprit. As a result, defense was effective when the number of accusers was small and the culprit was able to convince the inquisitor to consider that animosity might indeed have prevailed between the parties.

Then as now, it is very hard to establish whether one hates someone else. Inquisitors tended to give greater credit to claims that comprised descriptions of violence. Consequently, private violence emerged as a juridical category that provided a clearer indication of animosity to inform a lawsuit. Furthermore, inquisitors accepted evidence of hate between the culprit and denouncers’ family members, as if there was a transitive property of hatred within the family: the enemy of one’s uncle is also the enemy of the nephew/niece and so forth.

The corpus of inquisitorial files examined comprises those initiated by the sweeping wave of imprisonments cautiously directed against New Christian merchants resident in Porto between 1618 and 1621. Amid them, the case of Manuel Rodrigues dos Santos is emblematic. He managed to escape to Madrid, and with the help of other Portuguese New Christians in Spain, he embarked in slave trafficking journey to Africa. Recognized and denounced along the way, he was arrested in Angola and brought to the Inquisition in Lisbon at the end of 1622.

By the time of his imprisonment, Santos had only two accusers. A third person denounced him while he was already in prison. This was a considerably small number of accusers vis-à-vis his fellow townsmen imprisoned shortly before him. Santos denied all accusations against him and presented long lists of impeachment articles. The first list contained 81 articles.

He succeeded to make a point that two of his accusers disliked him. He also made a case that the husband, uncle, brother and brother-in-law of the final denouncer hated him too. He also claimed that this last denouncer’s accusations were false, because he was not in Porto but in Madrid at the time of the “crime” informed by the Inquisition’s prosecutor to the culprit and his lawyer.

After more than four years in prison and a torture session, Santos was pronounced suspect of heresy and convicted to a year of banishment in the hinterland village of Évora Monte. Culprits who remained either “negative,” i.e., denied all charges, or “diminutes,” those who did not confess a number of charges, were submitted to torture. Undergoing torture without confession was a delicate tactic. It could be a sign of either innocence, if there were few and not very grounded charges, or of pertinacity in one’s heresy. The former could lead to absolution or a mild penalty, whereas the latter lead to capital punishment. Santos’ sentence was a significantly mild one in both concrete and symbolic dimensions, compared to most cases deriving from the imprisonments in Porto around 1618– 1621.

It is true that Santos late imprisonment allowed him to prepare his defense better. He could know which fellow countrymen had already been imprisoned or freed, and most probably he was able to collect details about their confessions too. As a rule, accusations derived from confessions, which were the only other alternative for those who were unable to make a solid defense and undergo torture, and wished to avoid capital punishment. Confessing having had accomplices who were not yet imprisoned was a sign of the culprit’s sincerity in the eyes of the Inquisition.

Santos’ defense was successful because he was able to make a case that he had fierce disputes with his accusers, their families and, not least important, with various members of the New Christian group in Porto, many of which ostensibly culminated in violent outbursts. As result, his claims that he was not very well liked among the pool of potential Judaizers, and not only those who directly denounced with as a heretic, were more credible.

The origins of alleged animosity varied. It included business differences and competition, gambling, bullying, scandals about one’s sex life (adultery, prostitution, impotence), etc. Most cases convey the perpetrator’s narrative. All quarrels happened partially in public spaces and supposedly had witnesses. In one of the cases, a judged stepped in to halt violence with official sanction. Offenses to the father and uncle were claimed to be, and accepted as being, extensive to the defendant, as well as the offenses by the defendant were extensive to the offended family members. The same is true about family members of third parties who became involved in such quarrels. The participation of servants and slaves might have also been comprised within the scope of such “transitive property” of enmity. Moreover, assaults committed by servants and slaves certainly added to the narrative of public humiliation.

Even if the number of disputes with violent outcomes is higher in Santos’ file, and he might have been more of an aggressive character, such conduct was not significantly different from those recounted in other files of his fellow countrymen.

Santos also mentioned a number of aggressions perpetrated by non-group members. A civic officer committed one of them, allegedly under the influence of the defendant. The other was perpetrated by a butcher, and was included in the defense in order to make a case that the impeached parties were indeed defamed residents of the city. In fact, those brothers appeared to have some mental illness, as several culprits and the inquisitors themselves attest, although their father was a prominent jurist and one of the brothers attended the University of Coimbra. Only a few of these claims were investigated, when they referred to those who had actually accused the defendant.

A judicious researcher tends to look at these claims warily, particularly to its violent aspects. Defendants may have added such aggressive culmination to the incidents in order to magnify the severity of the dispute, and make a case before their adjudicators.

Witnesses confirmed that there was a kernel of truth on the accounts, but expressed reservations as to the accuracy of their details. In one case, the witness stated that he did not know “whether these were verbal or included knife strikes.” He claimed not having been present to the scene and having heard about it at the house of a New Christians, who according to him fled to Castile and died there. However, Amsterdam notarial records reveal that this runaway in fact escaped to Amsterdam. Hence, the reader may also doubt the veracity of the witnesses, whose testimonies most often were somewhat vague, as witnesses did not want to clearly side with either version. In the second case, the witnesses confirmed the quarrels around the auction and the beating with sticks by the public officers. However, they did not mention stabbing and, moreover, one of them did not recalled the impeached party ever being at the scene.

Even if many of these accounts were exaggerated, it does not mean that they were all entirely imaginary. In fact, notarial deeds from Amsterdam record a number of cases that resemble closely the accounts made in inquisitorial files. These cases involved recent émigrés of Jewish origin from Portugal. Were these manifestations of violence mere coincidences, calculated exaggerations or deep rooted social practices?

Much has been written about the ferment and fervent discords within the Amsterdam Sephardic community. However, most studies refer to such disputes around the community’s framework, establishment and authority, or with regard to Amsterdam Sephardim’s identity as a group. Less attention has been paid to the private acrimonious quarrels among its members, and to their social constraints and effects.

The affidavits about the brawl between Jacob Montesinos and the Veiga brothers point to striking similarity in both content – motivations, expression of anger, manifestations of violence, etc. – and style, in which such disputes were narrated. Both this and other cases of interpersonal violence among Sephardic Jews in Amsterdam underline both the assumption and actuality of the transitive property of animosity.

Montesinos and the Veigas had business dealings, many common friends and dwelled, at least temporarily, in the same building. The latter were accused of bankruptcy fraud and embezzlement, or at least incompetence as agents. They were also blamed for being harmfully and aggressively inclined. Their sisters were said to be public prostitutes in the Southern Low Countries.

The affidavits were testimonies about the good reputation of the Veiga brothers, who were in prison for their debt at that time. The quarrels involved swords and knives, and promise to kill enemies through relatives. Vows to “bring all harm one could” on an adversary were either not as formulaic as Inquisition sources might suggest or were a topos in conflicts at the time. Sexual defamation was an important way to bring harm to an opponent, as well as other insults such as the “many other affronting words against the arrested parties and their sisters, which were very bad and scandalous, and are inappropriate to be brought before this Senate \[City Council or Court\].”

Family members were implicated in the squabbles and servants took part in it. Both this and other cases of private violence underline both the assumption and actuality of the transitive property of animosity. The involvement of authorities, such as those who imprisoned the Veigas, entailed greater offense. Third parties intervened in order to bring the opponents apart, and group members censured the aggressor, saying “that it was wrong to want to kill a man in that way,” meaning tied up. Moreover, a group member reminded him the consequences that such form of dispute could bring upon the group in general. He would have said to Montesinos “why he did so, why he made two honored men be arrested, and that he dishonored the \[Portuguese Jewish\] nation so.” In other cases, authorities also stepped in to halt altercations.

Both in Amsterdam and in Porto, those involved in these brawls were far from being marginal elements of the Western Sephardic Diaspora. Sources’ bias makes it difficult to establish what was the extent or the actual severity of these aggressive disputes. However, it is clear that some level of aggression was frequent.

The instances in which aggression occurred suggest that it was a reaction to the power of gossip and to gossip’s limits in securing social control through either collective action or official sanction. Gossip could bring much social and economic damage but not efficient social control.

**1st List of Impeachment Articles (81 articles)**

4 He \[the culprit\] will prove that Antonio da Costa and his wife, Isabel de Brito, and his father-in-law, Francisco de Brito, and Francisco Ribeiro and Sebastião Ribeiro, both uncle and cousin of the aforesaid \[Antonio da Costa\] and their wives and children are capital enemies of the defendant. The reason for the enmity arose when the defendant brought a consequential lawsuit at the royal civil court \[_juízo do corregedor do cívil_\] in that city \[Porto\] against the aforesaid Francisco Ribeiro over a shipment of sugar that the defendant had sold to him. During the judgment, when the witnesses were heard at the home of the clerk André Pinto, the said Antonio da Costa was about to bear witness, standing before the doorstep of the said clerk. Then, the defendant said to him to mind how he swore, saying that he should not swear as his father-in-law, Francisco de Brito, who always swore falsely against the defendant, do. Over this issue, they exchanged bad words, blows and knife strokes. Many people came between. From that time on, both became deadly enemies, saying bad things about each other. For this reason, all the aforesaid \[relatives of Antonio da Costa\] became deadly enemies of the defendant, and their testimonies may not bring harm to him.

18 He will prove that Manuel de Andrade, resident in Porto, is his deadly enemy. The reason for their enmity is that, in 1615, he, the defendant, sold two shipments arriving from Brazil worth of 280,000 réis, which were laden on the ships whose masters were Frutuoso Gonçalves of Massarelos and Francisco Maio of Matozinhos. The defendant agreed with the said Manuel de Andrade that he would transfer these shipments for the same price that they had cost in Brazil but the said Manuel de Andrade would shoulder the risk. After executing the sale and the agreement, the Turks robbed both ships and took them to Algiers. When the defendant demanded payment of both shipments from the said Manuel de Andrade, the latter did not want to pay, saying that he did not owe anything, since he did not receive these shipments, and that the defendant had deceived him because at the time of the sale, the defendant knew that the ships had been seized. The defendant and the said Manuel de Andrade had many arguments, great hatred and insults against each other. As a result, the said Manuel de Andrade felt affronted and publicly said that he would take revenge on the defendant from such words and insults, as well as from the money that the defendant took on account of the shipments. What is more:

19 He will prove that while the defendant was on the quays, at which the ships are unloaded in the said city of Porto, walking with the discharge clerk, Francisco Pais, the said Manuel de Andrade approached him with a sword in hand. The latter came together with a servant, who also held a sword. Andrade said that he had already paid the money of those shipments that he had sent to him, and that he was watching him closely, observing when he was going to swim, or where he went to and where came from, and other of such \[threatening\] words. The defendant replied, and the said Manuel de Andrade became very affronted, grasping his sword. The defendant did the same, and the said Francisco Pais came between. From then on, they became much more inimical, and therefore his testimony may not bring harm to him, the defendant.

27 He will prove that in 1617, during the yearly auction of the lease of the rights over the “entrances of the sea” \[municipal duties on imports\], of which the defendant was the leaseholder during the previous year, the aforesaid Antonio Cardoso Pereira, together with other enemies of the defendant, went to bid for the said rights on the public square where the royal judges and city council members were about to auction them off. The said Antonio Cardoso Pereira and his partners \[in the bid\] said some bad words about the defendant with regard to the conditions of the lease. Then, the said royal judges, the city council members and the city council clerk beat him \[Pereira\] with the sticks \[which were ceremonially used in the auction\] and stabbed him with daggers and had him arrested. As a result, the aforesaid Antonio Cardoso Pereira became very affronted and insulted, saying publicly that we would take revenge on the defendant for the offences that the royal judges, city council members and city council clerk had done to him, since the defendant was the cause of them \[...\]

29 He will prove that Simão Lopes Pinheiro, resident in the city of Porto, is his deadly enemy. The reason for their enmity is that the said Simão Lopes Pinheiro was at the home of Miguel Barbosa, burgher \[civic title\] and resident in Porto, where Antonio Rodrigues, father of the defendant, was also present. Both had doubts over gambling, and called each other insulting and affronting names, and through cards and candlesticks on each other. Simão Lopes Pinheiro became very offended and nurtured great hatred both against him, the defendant, and against his father.

31 He will prove that when the said Simão Lopes Pinheiro and the defendant’s father met after the said quarrel next to the forecourt of the Saint Domenic Monastery of the said city of Porto, they drew their swords and stroke each other until many people came between and separated them. Yet they still tried to kill each other, slashing and fighting wherever they met each other owing to the great hatred they nurtured against each other.

32 He will prove that after Dr. Luis Pereira, royal criminal judge of the said city of Porto, heard about the said fights and hatred between the said Simão Lopes and Antonio Rodrigues, the defendant’s father, who was his neighbor, and he stipulated penalties in money and years \[of banishment\] in Africa on the aforesaid parties so that they would not fight or argue with each other. The clerk of the criminal court, Serafim Correa, executed a warrant of such content.

36 He will prove that João Rodrigues Villareal and his wife and daughter, and Luis Antonio, his son-in-law, residents in the city of Porto, are his deadly enemies after a fight that Jeronimo Rodrigues, dubbed “mestre sala” \[master of ceremonies\], had with the impeached witness over certain doubts on the forecourt of the Saint Dominic Monastery in the said city of Porto. After calling each other names, the said Jeronimo Rodrigues called the said João Rodrigues Villareal cuckold \[_cornudo_\] publicly. The latter became very affronted. Many relatives and friends of him were present, and all of them came to help him to kill the said Jeronimo Rodrigues. The defendant was also there, together with Santos de Souza, burgher of the said city, and he came to help the said Jeronimo Rodrigues, and he supported and protected him from the said João Rodrigues and his relatives. The defendant brought him to his home and sheltered him in his office. As a result, the said João Rodrigues and the said Luis Antonio, his son-in-law, and all their relatives became public enemies of the defendant, saying that they would take revenge on him for the affront that the said Jeronimo Rodrigues had made to them and because he \[the defendant\] supported and defended him, and prevented them to take revenge right away on the said Jeronimo Rodrigues \[...\]

49 He will prove that the Licentiate Tome Vaz and his sons Antonio Vaz, Diogo de Pina, Andre Nunes Pina2, Tomas Nunes Pina, and his daughters Aldonsa Nunes and Catarina de Pina, and Paulo Lopes da Cunha, husband of the said Catarina de Pina, and Antonio da Fonseca Pina and Jeronimo da Fonseca Pina, nephews of the said Tomé Vaz, and first cousins of the aforesaid \[sons and daughters of Tomé Vaz\], all residents in the city of Porto, are his deadly enemies. The impeached witness Tomé Vaz brought a lawsuit against his \[Vaz’s own\] son André Nunes Pina over alimony that his son demanded twelve or thirteen years earlier. The former expelled him from his home without providing him sustenance. For this reason, the said André Nunes went through much privation and appeared in the neighbors’ homes asking them help. Once, the defendant counseled the said André Nunes, saying that one of his sisters, Aldonsa Nunes, was the cause of the said Tomé Vaz, his father, expelling him from home and not awarding him alimony. The defendant suggested he waited for a day when she would be out of home and then scared and threatened her so that she would not cause her father to hate him any longer.

50 He will prove that a few days after he gave such advice to the said André Nunes, the said Licentiate Tome Vaz went to relax next to \[Douro\] river together with his daughters. At night, he retired back home with them. Meanwhile, following the defendant’s advice, the said André Nunes awaited his father and sisters, and stroke the head of one of them, Aldonsa Nunes, with a sword that he had borrowed from the defendant for this purpose. As a result, the said Aldonsa Nunes was in danger of death, and became very insulted, affronted and defamed.

51 He will prove that after the Licentiate Tomé Vaz and his sons, daughters, nephews and relatives got to know that it was the defendant who advised the said André Nunes to hit his sister, Aldonsa Nunes, and for this purpose lent him the sword. Hence, they complained about the defendant publicly and nurtured great hatred, declaring themselves his deadly enemies and proclaiming to take revenge on him for that affront in whatever way they could.

52 He will prove that while he, the defendant, let some sugar crates, which he had them washed, to dry, the said Antonio Vaz, Tomas Nunes, Diogo de Pina and André Nunes, sons of the said Tomé Vaz, stole two of the said crates. When the defendant found the shortage, he publicly complained about them, saying that they were thieves who had stolen those two crates. After hearing about the insults, the said Diogo de Pina and Antonio Vaz came to call him to account, saying that it was only Tomas Nunes and André Nunes \[and not all of them\] those who had stolen his crates. The defendant became very angry and immediately beat and slapped the said Diogo de Pina and Antonio Vaz publicly, calling them thieves and other offensive names. For this reason, they and their relatives became very affronted and insulted, nurturing further hatred against the defendant.

53 He will prove that while the defendant was fighting against the said Antonio Vaz and Diogo de Pina over the theft of the said crates, a black \[either a slave or a servant\] of the defendant came behind them with a stick and hit the head of the said Antonio Vaz, who became even more affronted, as well as his relatives \[...\]

58 He will prove that a butcher hit with a beefsteak the snout \[sic.\] of the said Antonio Vaz, because he had been faultily informed Antonio Vaz had clothing made with a sum of 4,000 réis that the latter had judicially recovered from the butcher. For this and other reasons, Antonio Vaz was considered a defamed person in the said city of Porto, and therefore no credit was to be given either to him or to his brothers.

**2nd List of Impeachment Articles:**

3 He will prove that Antonio da Costa and Doctor Nicolau Lopes Vila Real, residents in the city of Porto, mentioned in the articles nos. 4 and 5 and following ones of his impeachments, are deadly enemies of the defendant. In addition to the reasons mentioned in those articles of impeachment, they were enemies for another reason. Once both Antonio da Costa and Nicolau Lopes were together, in 1616, according to his memory, outside the Postern of the Fountain of the Virtues of that city of Porto, mocking a certain Miguel Dias, uncle of the defendant, brother of his father. Miguel Dias was an imbecile and a madman \[_mentecapto_\], who lived at the home of the defendant on his expenses. When the defendant arrived and saw that the aforesaid impeached witnesses were mocking his uncle and abusing him, he fought against them and said very affronting words, insulting them greatly. The latter in turn called him drunkard, defamed and cuckold \[_cornudo_\], and said other offenses, which made him assault them. They came to blows, and as a result, the defendant became grazed and greatly hurt.

**Investigation of the 1st List of Impeachment Articles in Porto on February 18, 1625:**

\- Manuel Cordeiro, half New Christian, minter, resident of Porto, of about 65 years of age

\- Among the people mentioned in the article he knew only the defendant and Antonio da Costa and his wife, Isabel de Brito, and his father-in-law, Francisco de Brito.

\- He was aware that “\[fol. 13 of the investigation\] the defendant brought a lawsuit over a shipment of sugar against Francisco Ribeiro, from this city, before the royal civil court, and that Andre Pinto was the clerk of that cause. The witness was informed that over such lawsuit, the defendant had differences with Antonio da Costa, but the witness does not know whether these were \[merely\] verbal or included knife strikes, because he was neither present nor heard it, but he only heard about it from other people. Asked if he remembered the quality of such differences and the names of the persons who had told him such, he said that he does not remember, but that he heard that being told at the house of João Cardoso, who was of the nation of the New Christians and is said to be deceased in Castile, to where he fled at the time of the \[great\] imprisonment \[in Porto\]3, about six years earlier. The witness further said that the defendant and the said Antonio da Costa did not talk to each other, and did not say further about this article.”

**Investigation of the 3rd list of impeachment articles in Porto on December 10, 1625  
(including a few articles of the 1st list):**

7 - Afonso Cardoso, burgher of Porto, of about 60 years of age:

\-  He knew the defendant since the latter was a child, and knew that he was a merchant.

\-  About art. no. 27, he said that: “\[p. 8\] he, the witness, was a city council member \[_vereador_\] in this city, in the year in which the defendant wished to win the bid over the lease of the “entrances of the sea and the land,” of which the defendant was the leaseholder the previous year. Wishing to lease it again, the defendant bid an offer. Seeing that other people were also bidding, the royal judge, who wanted to favor the defendant, hit with a stick one of the bidders, favoring therefore the defendant, but the witness does not know the impeached party even though he heard that all of them \[bidders\] had differences among themselves, and did not say further.”

8 - Antonio Pereira, burgher of Porto, factor of the customs house, of about 42 years of age:

\-  He knows the defendant for 15 years, since the latter was a merchant and attended the customs house.

\-  Regarding art. no. 27, he said that “\[p. 9\] he knows Antonio Pereira Cardoso or Antonio Cardoso Pereira, who is the impeached party, very well, and remembers that in the mentioned auction there were differences between the defendant and the other bidders, but he does not remember the impeached party, Antonio Cardoso Pereira, being present when such differences and the end of the auction took place. The royal judge did hit one of the bidders with a stick, but he does not remember who was this. He did not say further about the article, except that he knew that because he was present at the time, when he served the office of representative \[_procurador_\] of the city \[to the court\]”.
