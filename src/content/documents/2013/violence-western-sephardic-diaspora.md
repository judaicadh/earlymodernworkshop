  Recurrent private acts of violence within dense and homogenous communities, or
  diasporas, illustrate a tension between powerful gossip transmission and
  imperfect translation of such power into efficient social control.


  This presentation explores the manifestation of private violence in the daily
  life of the Western Sephardic Diaspora in the early seventeenth century,
  examining inquisitorial sources from Portugal and notarial records from the
  Netherlands. These sources indicate that as much as group members expected
  mutual responsibility, trustworthiness and compliance with social norms from
  their fellow group members. Yet when they felt disappointed, they expressed
  their resentment aggressively. Aggression took shape of offenses and beating
  with hands, sticks and various other objects, including cold steel. The body
  of sources suggests that the Western Sephardic Diaspora involved a
  significantly fervid environment.
