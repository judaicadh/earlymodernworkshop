  Violence is often linked to power and physical strength. Violence is typically

  in the hands of an oppressed minority, as in case of Diaspora Jewry, which has
  been identified with victimhood. Moreover, in historiography, the perception
  of Jews as targets of aggression perpetrated by “the other,” whether Christian
  or Muslim, corresponds to the widely held idea that Jewish men differ from
  their non-Jewish peers. The prototype of the “unmanly Jew,” even labeled as
  “effeminate” Jewish man – i.e., gentle, non-violent, valuing words over
  actions – runs deep in European and Jewish cultural history as a counter-image
  to the gentile ideal of muscular and forceful masculinity and takes on various

Violence is often linked to power and physical strength. Violence is typically associated with ruling authorities and the realm of the majority, rather than in the hands of an oppressed minority, as in case of Diaspora Jewry, which has been identified with victimhood. Moreover, in historiography, the perception of Jews as targets of aggression perpetrated by “the other,” whether Christian or Muslim, corresponds to the widely held idea that Jewish men differ from their non-Jewish peers. The prototype of the “unmanly Jew,” even labeled as “effeminate” Jewish man – i.e., gentle, non-violent, valuing words over actions – runs deep in European and Jewish cultural history as a counter-image to the gentile ideal of muscular and forceful masculinity and takes on various shapes, with negative as well as positive connotations.

The vernacular legend of the Red Jews allows us to explore the relationship of violence, physical strength and power during the early modern period, extending the traditional treatment of Jews and violence in that era. The term “Red Jews,” a unique vernacular characterization of the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel, was in circulation among Jews and Christians in German- and Yiddish-speaking regions in the late Middle Ages and early modern period. The Red Jews were fabled to live beyond the mysterious Sambatyon River, where they would reside until the time comes for them to assist the Messiah – i.e., the Antichrist in Christian lore – taking revenge for centuries of anti-Jewish oppression by bringing apocalyptic destruction to Christianity at the end of days. This legend was immensely popular among both Jews and Christians and appears in many versions in a range of genres, in both manuscript and print.

One of its German variants is included in _Der Göttweiger Trojaner Krieg_ (The Göttweig Trojan War; Text 1), a Middle High German verse romance that originated in northern Switzerland circa 1270-1300. It presents narrative material relating to the Trojan War of Greek antiquity with a burlesque twist, entwined with motifs from the Arthurian romance. Here, during their battles against Troy, the Greeks encounter the horrible Red Jews. Whereas the German account depicts these terrifying Jews as huge and robust, equipped with military skill that is linked to aggressive and violent might, the Yiddish _Ma’ase Akdamut_ (Story of Akdamut; Text 2) presents a more complex picture. The version presented here – the oldest known and most popular of the early modern Yiddish versions of the Red Jews' story, transmitted in a Yiddish manuscript of edifying historical and narrative texts (c. 1580-1600) preserved in the Bodleian Library, Oxford – conveys a tension between the well-established notion that violence can only be exercised by those who wield conventional strength and power and a Jewish revenge fantasy whose unlikely hero is a little, frail and elderly Red Jew who walks with a limp. While his physical abilities may be limited, this Red Jew triumphs in the end by means of a source of power that is less readily visible, namely magic that uses the divine names.

\[...\]

These fine \[Greek\] warriors, the very best

entered another land,

\[whose inhabitants\] were called Plotzen.\[^1\]

This was the land of Red Jewry,

which is still spoken of in many lands today.

They were a poisonous lot indeed.

From travellers they demanded a very heavy toll,

\[so\] it is said.

Their country stretched far and wide

\--- _line missing_ \---.

Virtue and modesty

they all lacked.

As a rule they were

huge and horrible,

and so thoroughly foul

that anyone who encountered them was frightened for his life.

Ulysses the faint-hearted was seen

bewailing his misery,

but He who had often saved him, provided estimable solace.

It had to be and must come to pass: the noble knights, the best there were,

armed themselves for battle;

but they certainly had never

before been in such distress.

Right up to their grim deaths

they were attacked

by many faithless men

who despised the lords,

they themselves knew why.

\[...\]

When the ship had to come ashore,

Hercules \[i.e., Ulysses\] saw

an innumerable horde

riding toward the vessel.

But, fearful man that he was,

he fled to the bilge of the ship,

and lay hidden there

until the twelfth morning.

The worthy knights  
had to defend themselves  
immediately  
against these hateful hell-hounds.  
They \[i.e., the Red Jews\] all wore  
terrible body armor made from horn  
with whole steel rings underneath,  
their helmets were very shiny;  
well-fashioned and skillfully forged,  
their shields remained unscarred except with great effort from a hand-held a sword.  
The damned ones \[destined to die\] desired battle,  
they wanted the gold of the Greeks  
and the ship for booty.

The princes had to fend off their threat.

May God protect the heroes for us!

The noise of men and striking swords

was so extremely loud

that no one

can accurately describe the prowess

of these creatures.

Mighty and terrifying

was the horror of battle.

Grim death

conquered many a man;

but I don’t curse its cruelty.

Many a helmet,

skull and beard

were cloven by swords.

Ah, Venus, thou Empress,  
I mean you, praiseworthy Dame of Love, stand by your servants  
and free them of all care!  
Her answer: “Friend Wolfram,  
I do not abandon my servants.”

Ajax the mighty prince,

with manly courage exalted above all others,

felled many a one in his blood,

just as the goodly young knight

Aminall did, whose mighty sword

injured and cut many.

This horrifying battle

lasted until the twelfth day.

Many a strong Red Jew

lay dead, wretched.

At that time

the balsam was found

that, still today, in times of affliction

raises men's spirits.

Twenty thousand of the Red ones

were killed on those days,

and the remainder

fled to the mountains.
