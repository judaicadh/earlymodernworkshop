description: The vernacular legend of the Red Jews allows us to explore the
  relationship of violence, physical strength and power during the early modern
  period, extending the traditional treatment of Jews and violence in that era.
  Violence is often linked to power and physical strength. Violence is typically
  associated with ruling authorities and the realm of the majority, rather than
  in the hands of an oppressed minority, as in case of Diaspora Jewry, which has
  been identified with victimhood. Moreover, in historiography, the perception
  of Jews as targets of aggression perpetrated by “the other,” whether Christian
  or Muslim, corresponds to the widely held idea that Jewish men differ from
  their non-Jewish peers. The prototype of the “unmanly Jew,” even labeled as
  “effeminate” Jewish man – i.e., gentle, non-violent, valuing words over
  actions – runs deep in European and Jewish cultural history as a counter-image
  to the gentile ideal of muscular and forceful masculinity and takes on various
  shapes, with negative as well as positive connotations.
