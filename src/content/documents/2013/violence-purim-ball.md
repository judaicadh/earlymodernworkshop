On March 21, 1753 Francesco Masi, lieutenant of the Livornese Bargello \[police\] brought a suit against Angelo Soria, David Montefiore and Abram Soria, all members of the _Nazione Ebrea_, who on March 20 were attending the ball organized by Elia Ottolenghi (also a member of the _Nazione Ebrea_) in his home, and since they had started exchanging verbal offenses, and then came to blows, with Abram Pardo there, one of the above mentioned extracted a stiletto of a prohibited type during such act, although no physical harm was inflicted with this weapon.

To clarify what the plaintiff expounded in his accusation, and the use of the prohibited weapon, not only were those witnesses named by the plaintiff examined, but also some other ones who during the trial were believed to have information about the event.

The first witness, who is Jacob da Costa, when queried about the type of the weapon says thus, here \[i.e., copying verbating from the interrogation\]: “In that commotion \[?\] I observed that Angiolo Soria was holding a knife in his hand, but I am unable to tell you which kind it was.” And further down here: “It certainly must have been a prohibited weapon, because he would not have brought it with him if it were harmless, but I am not at all able to describe it precisely.” And further down here: “But you will not find anybody who can tell you what this weapon was precisely, because the confusion was too great.”

Jacob Attias, second witness, says thus regarding the weapon, here: “I saw that a blade flashed and glimmered in the air,” and further down here: “As I am saying, as soon as I saw the commotion and withdrew to another room, I noticed the glimmer of a sort of weapon in the air, but how it was or wasn’t, I do not know.”

Abram Frias, third witness, says thus about the weapon, here: “I can tell you that a little before the soldier came, I had seen that mask \[masked guest\], who said he was David Montefiore, put his hand \[642v\] in his pocket and take out a weapon, but it was barely possible to see which kind of weapon, although I saw it glimmer, and it was impossible to see which weapon was or wasn’t the one that this person was holding.” And further down here: “It could have been a stiletto because that sort of people do not carry knives, but I am repeating to you again that I am unable to tell you the precise type of that weapon.” And further down here: “The weapon was extracted, and if I knew of which type of it was, I would tell you.”

Abram Pardo Roques, who is the offended and insulted as far as the weapon is concerned, says thus here: “It was when I tried to punch him that I saw a weapon glimmer in his hand.” And further down: “As soon as I saw the weapon, he put it away, and it was not possible to see what it was, namely which weapon it was and how it was.”

Abram Zancò, fourth, who was the dancing master, Pincas Errera fifth, Lazzero Levi sixth, Alessandro Ottolenghi seventh witness, although closely queried regarding the weapon, assert that they did not see it.

Abram Rodrigues, eighth witness, says thus about the weapon, here: “Since said Pardo wanted to defend himself, I saw that that mask who had slapped him extracted a knife with which, however, he was not able to carry out any action.” And further down: “It was a glimmering knife, as far as could be seen because of the \[dim\] lights, and it was a knife with an eight- or ten- finger-long blade, and I think that it looked like a Flemish-type knife, but there was no time to observe it carefully, since the soldier arrived immediately and started hitting \[?\].” And further down here: “I did not take the knife in my hand, and I am saying that I think it was a Flemish-type knife, certainly sharp and new, because it was glimmering, and as I say there was no time to observe it well.”

The ninth, tenth and thirteenth witnesses who were present at the event, the first two of whom are Christian, attest that they did not see the weapon. We are excluding the eleventh and twelfth witnesses because they testified \[684r\] about other circumstances irrelevant to the weapon.

Such is accurately reported from the documents, therefore since it does not seem to me that there is sufficient evidence to believe that any of the three individuals denounced in the accusation regarding the prohibited weapon are guilty, concerning this case I would keep the trial open until new evidence is brought forward. And as far as the offended Abram Pardo, who requested in his examination to proceed against Abram Soria for the slap \[Soria\] gave him, since \[Pardo’s\] father withdrew the complaint that is part of the trial, I would not pursue it any further. I am ever deferring to the most just determinations of Your Cesarean Majesty, in front of whom, with profound submission and respect, I bow to kiss the imperial mantle,

Carlo Ginori.
