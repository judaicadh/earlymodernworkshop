description: >-
  Jews are often portrayed as non-violent and therefore as powerless victims.
  Highlighting and examining cases of Jews as violent perpetrators not only
  refutes this stigmatization of Jews, it also reveals much about day to day
  life, about personal and social conflicts both within Jewish society and in
  encounters with the Christian society.


  Discussed here sections of a legal document from the Geheimes Staatsarchiv
  Preussischer Kulturbesitz, Berlin Dahlem cover a court case against the Jewish
  servant, Samuel Saul, who was suspected of having murdered the Jewish maid
  Zierle in Prussia in 1791.
