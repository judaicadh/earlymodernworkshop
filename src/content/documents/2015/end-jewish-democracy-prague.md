description: >-
  One intriguing register for considering continuities and changes in Jewish
  life in the early eighteenth century is the constitution of the autonomous
  Jewish community, or _kehillah_. This institution of Jewish self-government
  was formed at the nexus of the imposition of governments, on the one hand, and
  Jewish collective investment in the legitimacy and utility of this form of
  association, on the other..


  Although Jewish communal leadership appears to have been determined by
  elections in the earlier centuries of this period, by the seventeenth and
  eighteenth centuries an increasing trend towards permanent ruling oligarchies
  can be discerned. A standing patriciate is in evidence in Frankfurt by the
  1620s, and Prague, while it maintained a contentious partisan structure
  throughout the seventeenth century, succumbed to a permanent oligarchy in
  1703.


  The following document represents the decisive moment (on November 10, 1703),
  when Emperor Leopold decreed an end to Jewish democracy in Prague, and
  replaced it with a standing governing body. Of particular note are a number of
  salient themes, including the relationship between royal/imperial fiat and
  Jewish self-government, the function of the kehilla as a tax-farming entity as
  the critical basis for its legitimacy in the eyes of the state, royal
  awareness of factionalism and strife among Jews, and, subtly but importantly,
  efforts by the Habsburg monarchy to bring Jewish administration into line with
  other denizens of the realm.
