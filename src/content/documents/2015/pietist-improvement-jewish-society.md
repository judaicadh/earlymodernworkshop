  In 1748/49, Isaac Wetzlar of Celle in Northern Germany completed _Libes Briv_
  (Love Letter), a Yiddish proposal for the improvement of Jewish society. In
  order to initiate exploration of the complex relationship between Central
  European Judaism and eighteenth-century Pietism selected sources are discussed
  that concentrate on the links between _Libes briv_ and the contours of German
  Pietism. These sources demonstrate that Isaac Wetzlar’s _Love Letter_ (edited
  and translated into English by M. Faierstein) substantially engages the
  concepts and initiatives encompassed by Pietist missionary efforts to Jews.
  The diaries of two travelling missionaries from the Institutum Judaicum in
  Halle who came to Celle several times in the 1730s as part of their quest to
  convert Jews document that Wetzlar engaged in theological discussions with at
  least one of them (cf. presentation by A. Siluk, source 1, “Travelling Journal
  of Johann Georg Widmann, 1732”).


  The sources introduce Isaak Wetzlar’s _Love Letter_ as a calculated response
  to the challenge posed by Pietist missionaries and Christian critiques of
  Jewish life: Wetzlar’s call for religious and social renewal seems to compete
  with contemporaneous Christian Pietists over the preferable vision for
  eighteenth-century Central European Jewry.
