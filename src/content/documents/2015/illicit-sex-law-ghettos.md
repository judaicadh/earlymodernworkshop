description: This presentation explores the changes of attitudes toward illicit
  sexual relations within the ghetto societies that occurred in Italy between
  the late seventeenth century and the middle of the eighteenth century, with a
  specific focus on young Jewish maidservants. It analyzes how Italian Jewish
  leadership, both lay and rabbinical, acted in regard to the vicissitudes of
  Jewish women who faced seduction, sexual exploitation, and pregnancy under the
  Jewish roof. This analysis uses archival sources from both Jewish courts and
  civic magistracies in the cities of Venice, Mantua, and Modena during the
  years 1691-1751. Through a combination of paternalism, cohesiveness,
  innovation, and surveillance, Italian Jewish communities were capable of
  containing destabilizing behaviors within the society, and reintegrating women
  who otherwise would have been tragically lost by obliging the seducers to
  marry them, or to take care of them as well as their illegitimate children. As
  recent scholarship has demonstrated, in both contemporaneous Italian Christian
  contexts and other European Jewish communities women in similar conditions
  were often rejected and left alone, along with their illegitimate offspring.
