description: This presentation focuses on Jewish attitudes towards non-Jews in
  the first half of the 18th century as depicted in the travelling journals of
  Pietist missionaries. If up to that point, interreligious encounter had been a
  field of interaction between Jewish and Christian scholars, in the 18th
  century the missionaries began to engage in conversations on faith with Jews
  of all social strata, genders, ages and educational backgrounds. Such
  interactions yielded many different forms of individual and communal Jewish
  reactions. Examining cases of missionary encounters with the large urban Jewry
  of Frankfurt (Main) and the smaller, rural _kehilah_ of Celle (in the
  Principality of Hanover), I will discuss the different levels of openness Jews
  displayed in their interaction with the missionaries and their connection to
  the respective communal structure and living conditions of each settlement. In
  addition, I will show that, in contrast to older views, one should not confuse
  the openness of Jews towards their Christian environment with a decrease in
  faith, a decline in communal cohesion, or a dissolution of traditional
  structures. Finally, I will contrast the findings on the religious condition
  of the Jewry of Celle with the critique on the matter made by Isaak Wetzlar,
  the author of the ‘Libes briv’ (see the presentation by Rebekka Voß) and a
  member of the Celle _kehilah_.
