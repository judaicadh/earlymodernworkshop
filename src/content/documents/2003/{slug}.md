  Mysterium: About the Conversion of the Jews: As was situated and preached in
  the Strasbourg cathedral. Das ist Geheimnis S. Pauli Rom am II Von Bekherung
  der Juden als gelegt und geprediget zu Strassburg Munster. Strasbourg, 1592


  Elias Schadeus (1541-1593) held various pastoral positions in Strasbourg's
  Lutheran churches, beginning in 1570 until his death. In 1586, Schadeus was
  appointed as a Hebrew professor at Strasbourg's university. Like many of the
  Christian Hebraists in Strasbourg, Schadeus composed various grammatical
  textbooks, teaching students Hebrew grammar and language in an effort to
  instruct them in the truths of Christianity, based on the Hebraica Veritas.


  Schadeus also applied his knowledge of Hebrew in an attempt to actively
  convert the Jews. In his role as preacher at Strasbourg's cathedral from
  1581-1593, Schadeus preached tolerance of the Jew. Echoing the notion
  expressed by Martin Luther in his 1523 treatise, That Jesus Christ was Born a
  Jew, Schadeus argued that Christian kindness and economic inclusion would
  facilitate Jewish conversion. In addition, Schadeus founded a Hebrew printing
  press, through which he hoped to attract the Jews to Christianity through
  printed media in their own language. To this end, he translated five books of
  Luther's New Testament into Judaeo- German, which he published together with a
  preface, excerpts from the Old Testament, some of his sermons and additional
  arguments intended to attract the Jews to Lutheranism.


  Included in this published volume is a supplication to Strasbourg's council,
  in which Schadeus beseeches the magistrates on behalf of a young Jewess he had
  baptized as Susanna. His request, written ten years after her baptism, is that
  Susanna be granted the status of a Stattkind, a ward of the city. This status
  and the stipend involved would help combat her poverty and facilitate her
  marriage by enabling her to work within the city. This text reflects Schadeus'
  position that economic tolerance of Jews and of converts would facilitate
  conversion to Christianity. It also documents the desperation felt by Jewish
  converts to Christianity, who had difficulty integrating into both their old
  and new societies.
