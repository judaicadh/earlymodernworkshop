  **ABSTRACT:** Exploration of two contrary tendencies among colonial American
  Jews to achieve consensus within their religious fellowship. In one case, they
  relied upon European precedent by attempting to recreate the kehilla in
  America, while in the other they rejected European precedents that forbade
  commonality among Ashkenazim and Sepharadim. The outcome was a new kind of
  community: the voluntary one.

To the most noble audience and the holy Congregation Shearith Israel, whom God may increase,  
Illustrious Gentlemen  
Almighty God having permitted us to reach this so anxiously awaited moment, when we can begin to carry out our intention, so long the object of our desire, let us now fulfill our duty (and as He knows all things from their inception to their completion) let us now prepare for the foundations. The foundation should be good indeed for the house to be consecrated and dedicated to our blessed God, by whom we hope our prayers will be accepted. Let us therefore first implore our Lord, the Creator of all things, who is himself the beginning and origins of all that is good, to grant us His divine help.  
It is hereby made known to you all that the foundation stones are now for sale, with the exception of the first stone, which is to remain unsold for the present, awaiting the decision of Mr. Abraham de Mucata of London to whom it has been offered. But in order not to delay this holy work, it might be well that you designate some one to lay this first stone, such name not to be entered in the record, until we learn the decision referred to. The stones now offered for sale are Nos. 2, 3, and 4. In case of refusal, stone No. 1 will also be sold in public and the name of the purchaser entered on the record. It should be borne in mind that the gentlemen who buy said stones should pay their contribution so as to enable us to advance to the builders the amounts agreed upon. . . .  
The sale was as follows:  
Sabbath 9th of Ellul, 5489 \[September 3, 1729\]  
No. 2---Second stone---Mosseh Br Michaell . . .  
No. 3---Third stone---Binjamin mendez Pacheco. . .  
No. 4---Fourth stone---Jahacob Bar Naphtaly Francks. . . .

Mordy Gomez and David Lopez to sell in public on the Sabbath day the first stone of the building of the holy synagogue, which stone had been kept unsold because it had been offered to Mr. Abraham de Mucata of London, and his answer as to whether he accepted was pending, and as he did not accept, it was sold in public, as above mentioned, and was bought by Mr. Mosseh Bar Michaell for three pistoles. . . .
