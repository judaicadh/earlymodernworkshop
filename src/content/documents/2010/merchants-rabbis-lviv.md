  Josko of Lviv was one of the most important Jewish entrepreneurs in the late
  medieval Poland, specifically in the eastern provinces of Polish Kingdom,
  namely the voievodships of Russia and Lublin. Jossko engaged in the number of
  profitable commercial activities, but achieved real prominence as the
  leaseholder of royal customs in such important urban centers as Lviv, Lublin,
  Chelm and Belz. His successful service to Kazimierz Jagiellon, John Olbracht
  and Alexander Jagiellon became the point of contention during the session of
  Polish Diet in Lublin in 1505. In this year Polish parliament demanded that
  Josko would be removed from his official position in the royal service.
  Shortly after this dramatic intervention of the Polish noblemen Josko died in
  Lublin, and left behind his wife Golda and children. One of his sons, Shachna,
  a pupil of Jacob Pollack, became the foremost rabbinical authority in Poland,
  and his yeshiva graduated such influential scholars as Solomon Luria and moses
  Isserles. This presentation will examine the history of Josko and his family
  in the first three decades of 16th century. It will analyze the importance of
  Josko as the royal servant and how the fortune he left help his sons,
  especially Pyessak and Shachno to establish themselves as an important leader
  of the community in Lublin, and more broadly in eastern Poland. Number of
  important primary texts, issued mostly by the royal chancellery, will be
  utilized here, all pertaining to Josko and Shachno.

Prudent (_providus_) Martinus Szythko, architect/builder from Lublin, is standing before this office and its records, and abandoning all his other jurisdictions, is submitting his case to the castle (_grodzki_) court, and testifies publicly, that he made a contract for constructing the house on a hill, for the sum of 20 _marcas_ and 2 _grossis_ with Prudent (_providus_) Schachno, the doctor of the Jews from the district located near the Lublin castle (_subcastrum_).

First of all, he will build a day-room, from this room a chamber, from this chamber a room alias _Vychod_, and from this room another room until the end of the pool. From the last room, there will be a passage to the kitchen, and these will be _forstowanis_. And in the same place, near these rooms, the entrance halls, or _przysyonki_ will be built, and furthermore the antrance, another day room, with a kitchen belonging to this room, and from this kitchen _vychod_. And all of these will be lined from outside and inside with wooden boards. And all these entrance halls and rooms will be provided with wooden stilts. And on the top of these entrance halls and rooms will be built a bond, or _vyazanie_, so it will be closed and create atrium. And in this atrium will be built six rooms, or fortowane, with steps, benches, windows, and moreover there should be bought the stilts and curtains for the pool, rooms, entrance halls and kitchens; and from this part also silverware (?), or _slyophatky (slyopharki)_ for the entire house. (And with this) aforementioned architect Sythko obliged himself under the punishment of incarceration and tower, to conduct no other work for other people, other than on this house. And he obliged himself during this court case, to build this until the holiday of St. Jacob Apostle. And he provided the guarantee of another 22 _marcas._

Aleksander etc. we hereby declare that our Jew Josko was allowed to lease the duty chambers in Lwow and Belz between the holiday of the Purification of Mary 1506 and another holiday of the Purification of Mary 1508. For the reason of this lease, he was absolved and exempt from all the yearly payments, which he usually delivered to us for himself, his house and family, according to the custom of all our Jews. Similarly, we freed this Josko, his family and servitors from \[the iurisdiction\] of all our _wojewodas_, castellans, burgraves, judges, deputy judges and other our dignitaries and officials of any stature, for the entire period of these three years. However, because of the admonitions and demands of our lay and ecclesiastical councilors, and of the and emissaries of the Crown provinces congregated here, we removed aforementioned Josko from this lease; for this reason he is absolved. Hence, his desired indemnity is secured; we give aforementioned Josko, his family, servants and factors the freedom and exemption from things and goods he customarily delivered to us, also from all annual taxes he paid for himself, his house and properties, and from the jurisdiction of _wojewodas_, castellans, _starostas_, burgraves, judges, deputy judges and other our dignitaries and lay officials of any stature. We free and exempt them on the holiday of Purification of Mary in the aforementioned year one thousand five hundred and eight; we also decided, that during the period of the lease, neither Josko and his family should pay annual taxes and duties to the chambers in Lwow and Belz, nor should they be responsible to aforementioned courts, but only to us and these, who will be dispatched with our special letters of authorization. Therefore, we order you, who are or will be interested (have competence) in this, so that aforementioned Josko in these our freedoms (exemptions) preserve and guard during this time, and do not act against it (under the threat of losing our favours). Announced (Datum) during the parliamentary session (_conventione generali_) in Lublin, Saturday before the _Oculi_ Sunday (Third Sunday in Lent), in the year of Our Lord 1506.
