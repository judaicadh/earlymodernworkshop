description: >-
  Josko of Lviv was one of the most important Jewish entrepreneurs in the late
  medieval Poland, specifically in the eastern provinces of Polish Kingdom,
  namely the voievodships of Russia and Lublin. Jossko engaged in the number of
  profitable commercial activities, but achieved real prominence as the
  leaseholder of royal customs in such important urban centers as Lviv, Lublin,
  Chelm and Belz. His successful service to Kazimierz Jagiellon, John Olbracht
  and Alexander Jagiellon became the point of contention during the session of
  Polish Diet in Lublin in 1505. In this year Polish parliament demanded that
  Josko would be removed from his official position in the royal service.
  Shortly after this dramatic intervention of the Polish noblemen Josko died in
  Lublin, and left behind his wife Golda and children. One of his sons, Shachna,
  a pupil of Jacob Pollack, became the foremost rabbinical authority in Poland,
  and his yeshiva graduated such influential scholars as Solomon Luria and moses
  Isserles. This presentation will examine the history of Josko and his family
  in the first three decades of 16th century. It will analyze the importance of
  Josko as the royal servant and how the fortune he left help his sons,
  especially Pyessak and Shachno to establish themselves as an important leader
  of the community in Lublin, and more broadly in eastern Poland. Number of
  important primary texts, issued mostly by the royal chancellery, will be
  utilized here, all pertaining to Josko and Shachno.
