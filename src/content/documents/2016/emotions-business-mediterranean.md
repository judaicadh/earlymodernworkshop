<h2 style="text-align: center">Introduction</h2>

These five excerpts come from two letter books that belonged to Joseph Franchetti (ca. 1720-ca. 1794), a successful Jewish merchant of Mantuan origins based in Tunis. At the time of the correspondence (1776-1790), Franchetti was a chief partner in the _Salomone Enriches & Joseph Franchetti Company_, a family-based trading firm with interests in Tunis, Livorno, and Smyrna. In the 1770s and 1780s, the core of Franchetti’s business was the sale of Tunisian _chechias_. These hats, made in Tunis with European wool acquired from Livorno, were highly sought after in the Ottoman Empire, with Smyrna serving as key distribution center. The strategic arrangement of the Enriches and Franchetti Company, with its presence on three Mediterranean coasts, placed these entrepreneurs at the forefront of the _chechia_ trade in the last quarter of the eighteenth century.

The letter books do not preserve the official correspondence of the _Salomone Enriches & Joseph Franchetti Company_, which to the best of my knowledge has not survived and which would have dealt almost exclusively with commercial issues, but rather the private, unofficial exchanges between Franchetti and a number of partners and associates, among whom were his young sons and brother- in-law. While most extant business letters, as Francesca Trivellato has noticed, seldom “give us clues about the emotional lives of their authors and recipients” (at least when it comes to the Jewish, Mediterranean sphere), Franchetti’s correspondence constitutes an exception. These letters offer a glimpse into personal, often fraught exchanges between relatives who knew each other well and did business together, thus shedding light on a little studied, but common aspect of eighteenth-century Jewish life: the emotional relations and tensions between close relatives in transnational merchant families divided by great geographical distance.

After marrying Ester Baruch, Joseph had five children – four sons, Abraham (b. 1754), Reuben (b. 1757), Judah (b. 1760), and Isaac (b. 1763) – and a daughter, Sara (b. 1767). As with many Jewish family firms, male members of the immediate household were dispatched abroad to secure the company’s commercial position in distant markets. Joseph’s eldest child, Abraham, remained with his father in Tunis, but his younger sons were sent to learn the trade not long after reaching the age of majority. Reuben left home in 1771, at 14, first for Livorno, and later for Smyrna, where he worked with his uncle Benjamin Baruch. Judah left for Smyrna in May 1778 (at 18) to become a clerk, the first step in his mercantile apprenticeship. Isaac, the youngest son, was sent to Livorno during the same year, at 15, to pursue the same education. Between 1771 and 1778, thus, Joseph Franchetti saw three sons leave the family home. While Judah occasionally returned to Tunis for short periods of time, Joseph did not see Reuben and Isaac for well over a decade – if ever again. In the impossibility of bridging the distance that kept them apart, letters allowed Franchetti to maintain contact with his children. Indeed, correspondence was one of the key avenues for families to teach shared values across space, reinforcing rights and stressing obligations and duties; as David Cressy put it in his now classic discussion of seventeenth-century transatlantic communication, letters provided “an emotional lifeline \[...\] that stretched across the wide ocean to inform, comfort or persuade kinsmen and friends on the other side.” Between 1776 and 1790, Franchetti wrote over 360 letters in Italian and Hebrew addressed to his business associates. Of these, 78 (approximately 20%) were directed to his sons and brother-in-law. Although replies have not survived, it is possible to infer them based on Joseph’s reactions. The correspondence thus offers a rare entryway into Jewish familial relations as they evolved over the course of about fifteen years.

While the practices of diasporic merchants have been primarily studied by economic historians who concentrate on their business strategies, I will argue that we still need to fully understand the role that emotions played in shaping cross- cultural trade. There is a broad consensus that trans-regional family ties were crucial in ensuring the success of Jewish trading networks, both in the west and the east. But how were such ties maintained or challenged as family members dispersed, given the difficulty that geographical distance created in preserving affective bonds and reciprocal obligations? While family separation is often viewed as a natural ingredient of diasporic trade, with fathers sending sons abroad to man commercial outposts or marrying daughters off to cement alliances, it might be beneficial to emphasize “process” rather than “structure,” and consider these separations as emotionally fraught practices, rather than simply rational business choices. Although abundant evidence exists for certain mobile groups in the broader European and colonial societies of the eighteenth century – such as English traders whose families were divided by the Atlantic Ocean – we still know very little about the emotional worlds and values of Jewish family members who lived distant from each other, often in different lands. What expectations and concerns did they harbor?

My presentation will focus on the emotional world of Joseph Franchetti, filled with anxiety, anger, and longing. Among other things, Franchetti’s correspondence illuminates the strategies with which he attempted to control and strengthen bonds with his young sons living far away, as well as to educate and socialize them, preparing them for life in foreign regions whose customs were perceived as not only alien, but also potentially dangerous for Jewish piety and, thus, business. Considering Franchetti’s engagement with allures of acculturation and risks of estrangement will additionally help us reinsert emotions into the study of Jewish merchant culture.
