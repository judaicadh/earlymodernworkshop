<h2 style="text-align: center">Introduction</h2>

The documents presented here are three texts authored by prominent sixteenth-century kabbalists in the Galilean town of Safed, all dealing with wine. 

<p style="text-align: justify">The first is a lengthy passage from Moses Cordovero’s commentary on the Zohar, <em>Or Yaqar</em> (on parashah <em>Shemini</em>, and more specifically on Lev. 10:9) in which the author expounds on the kabbalistic reasons for keeping wine kosher. Cordovero emphasizes how, in light of this liquid’s connection to the supernal world of the <em>sefirot</em>, a Jew’s stringency and attention in preserving kosher wine from Gentile contact impacts the amount of holiness of this world, determining one’s state of purity or sinfulness in it as well as their portion in the World-to-Come.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify">The second and third short passages are culled from Hayyim’s Vital writings on the reasons behind the mitzwot<em> </em>(both commenting on parashah <em>Lekh</em> <em>Lekha</em>) about the kabbalistic meaning of practices involved in the circumcision ritual, with a special attention to the <em>metzizah</em>—a custom which involves juxtaposing and swapping wine and blood.</p><p style="text-align: justify">These texts highlight the inherent connection between wine and the divine, and inspire questions about the usage of this (kosher) beverage as a marker of Jewish identity, in both ritual and non-ritual, social practices. What is more, they invite us to inquire about the use of symbolic foodstuffs to echo and respond to Christian doctrines—specifically those surrounding the Eucharist—that Jewish sages with an audience largely consisting of returning conversos may have made in a deliberate manner, particularly at a time when those same doctrines were a matter of contention among Christian reformers and counter-reformers.</p>
