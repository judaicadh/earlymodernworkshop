**The _Sefer Mizvot_ from Casale Monferrato (late 16th century)**

The manuscript L. 17 of the Biblioteca Civica in Casale Monferrato, part of the De Conti collection, consists of 91 leaves (lacking the last two). It was transcribed and annotated by Maria Modena Mayer in 1985. Three hands can be identified: (1) ff. 1–38v, likely that of Israel Luria of Padua, whose name appears on the title page; (2) ff. 38v–44v, resembling the Hebrew script of Parma I and linked to a common earlier source; (3) ff. 44v–end, in a later script, copied with the others to form a compendium of women’s three ritual precepts.

Its third section, from which the following excerpt is drawn, compiles ritual rules for the three precepts prescribed to women, similar to previous codices.  It belongs to a production of Judeo-Italian and Italian manuscripts, derived from the _Seder Mitzvot Nashim_ tradition, and features unique hallah and bread recipes absent from other versions. This genre began with a Yiddish work, probably composed in Germany or by German Jews in Italy, that was later adapted in Italy, expanded and published in Poland, and eventually retranslated into Italian. Edward Fram’s _My Dear Daughter_ (2007) includes the annotated translation of Benjamin Slonik’s _Seder mizvot ha-nashim_ (The Order of Women’s Commandments), first published in Cracow in 1577 and later Cracow again (1585, 1595), Basel (1602), and Hanau (1627).  

The manuscript was owned by Ricca (Riccha) Ottolenghi of Villafranca di Verona, who married David Sacerdoti of Pavia in 1586 and later moved with him to Casale Monferrato where they had two children. Ricca was widowed and later remarried in 1603. Her name appears with that of the author/copyist Israel Luria of Padua on the cover page, and she also signed the manuscript with her first husband’s name, suggesting she acquired it between 1586 and her remarriage in 1603. Her possession situates the text within the domestic and devotional life of Jewish women in northern Italy, linking Padua, Verona, Pavia, and Casale. One witness to her wedding, Yaakov Heilprun—rabbi and educator of women—later translated and adapted Slonik’s work into Italian (_Mitzvot Nashim melammedah_, Venice 1616; Padua 1625; Venice 1652, 1711), adding reflections on women’s reading, foods, and household practices, and perhaps even drawing on Ricca’s manuscript. 

The text circulated both within women’s households and across rabbinic networks, revealing a northern Italian nexus where women’s devotional literature and rabbinic learning intersected. Food and cooking practices moved along these same routes, especially those rooted in Venice and northern Italy. It shows a fusion of Italian, Jewish-Italian, and Ashkenazi baking traditions. 

**Sumptuary Laws (Venice 1607)** 

This source contains excerpts on food and banquets from the sumptuary laws issued by the Jewish community of Venice on June 10, 1607, nearly a century after their admission as a body to the city and their confinement to the Ghetto in 1516. At that time, the community found itself caught in a jurisdictional dispute between the _Ufficiali al Cattaver_ and the _Cinque Savii alla Mercanzia_, both seeking authority over them and attempting to impose new restrictions, including changes to the hours of opening the gates of the Ghetto Vecchio and Nuovo, as well as the closing of the gate on the quays. In the same year, on October 3, the Ashkenazi Jews of Venice secured the renewal of their charter—after the previous one had expired on February 28—which permitted their continued residence in the city. Meanwhile, the Levantine and Ponentine Jews were also engaged in diplomatic negotiations with the Venetian government, since their charter was set to expire in August 1608. These developments took place against the broader backdrop of Venice’s struggle with the repercussions of the papal interdict of 1606–1607.

Following a series of regulations enacted by the _Provveditori alle Pompe_—the Venetian officials responsible for monitoring private behavior and consumption—the Jewish community felt compelled to introduce its own rules, urging members to curb expenses and avoid ostentatious displays of wealth. The Small Assembly—the Ghetto’s main governing and legislative body—passed sumptuary provisions recorded in the _Libro Grande_. These measures addressed weddings and private receptions, limiting the number of hot dishes (_vivande_) that could be served to four, likely due to their higher cost and sophistication. These four dishes could be accompanied by customary cold foods, such as “dry meat, tongue, sausages, and other preparations with herbs, along with salads, soups, and dishes made with giblets usually served at such meals.” 

The analysis and the contextualization of this text offer us, on the one hand, a glimpse into the culinary habits of Jews during their most festive celebrations, and on the other, an entry point into the more ordinary foods and everyday kitchens of the segregated Ghetto apartments in Venice.

**Feliciana Diaz’s Testimonies (April 1635)**

In 1635, the New Christian Feliciana Diaz—daughter of the Portuguese converts Odoardo Dias and Clara Teixeira—appeared before the Holy Office in Venice. Her testimony offers a window into the life of an affluent crypto-Jewish family navigating ghettos, churches, taverns, domestic spaces where religious boundaries blurred, and the inquisitorial tribunals themselves. She had faced similar proceedings earlier, in Pisa (1618 and 1626) and Milan (1625). Recently widowed in Florence, she told the Venetian Inquisitors that she had joined her openly Jewish uncle, Josef Senhor, in Venice, insisting that she had always considered herself Catholic while adopting Jewish customs out of necessity and respect. She recounted, too, that she had refused a marriage proposal from her uncle’s brother-in-law, Abram Aboaf, and instead deliberately sought the notice of a window repairman working in her uncle’s home, so that he might bring her case before the tribunal. 

Even through her carefully crafted rhetoric, her testimony reveals practices—such as eating meat on Fridays or during both Jewish and Christian festivals—that could at once affirm New Christian identity and expose practitioners to charges of Judaizing, paralleling, among others, the scrutiny directed at Morisco fasting during Ramadan in sixteenth-century Valencia. Taken together with scattered evidence from other sources, including translations in this collection, her account highlights the blending of Jewish and Mediterranean culinary traditions with Italian styles, linking the kitchens of Jewish families in the Venetian Ghetto to the households of New Christians both within the Ghetto and throughout the city.
