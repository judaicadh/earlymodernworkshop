  Havisando le donne che non sonno obbligate a levar   חלהquando farano del pane
  se non di queste cinque sorte de farina: tute le altre sorte de farina serija 
  עווןa levare חלה né tan pocho fare ברכת המוציא לחם מין הארץ  e questi sonno le
  cinque sorte de farina che si è obbligatto a levare חלה e non de altra sorte:
  farina di formento e de orzo e de segale e spelta e vena ma quando in queste
  cinque sorte li serà messedatto altri farini allora si è obligato a levar חלה
  e non altramente e non se puol fare מצות de פסח se non de queste cinque sorte
  tuti li altre farine non si è de oblige di dire ברכת המזון. 


  Avisando ancora che non si piglia חלה come la pasta è pocha, non arivando il
  שעור, perché seria עוון e non מצוה e serja ברכת לבטלה; perché serija molti
  doni impasterano per far de brazoloni overo delle fugace e piglieranno di
  quella poca pasta חלה pensando di fare מצוה e farano pechato e ברכת לבטלה: per
  questo è scritto nela nostra  תורהquale se intendeשעור חלה . A questo modo si
  fa: quelo saperà giustamente quanto sija il שעור חלה se piglia quarantatre ovi
  e un quinto metendoli in un כלי e che sija pieno raso di aqua e un ovo alla
  volta e si mete amente a pigliare tuta quela aqua che / si spendrà per sopra
  quel כלי quando li serà dentra tutti quelli מ׳׳ג ovi e sempre che se torà
  tanta farina con quela aqua che è avanzata da quelli מ׳׳ג בצים questo si
  adimanda שעור חלה e non altramente, perchè la parola חלה somma quarantatre. 


  Se una dona avesse una pasta o un levado che fosse ש׳׳ח e se avesse
  dimenticata a tor חלה e poi fosse stata mesidata con altra pasta quale se
  avesse pigliato חלה / non si potrà magniare de tuta quela prima né de la
  seconda per essere mesidata per fine che ritorna a pigliarne una altra volta
  חלה de tuta la pasta insieme. Ancora se una donna avesse piglià חלה da una
  pasta che vi fosse שעור חלה e poi facesse un altro paston ancora pilieno e
  torà חלה di questo altro che non serà שעור חלה e poi li miscerà insieme non se
  ne poterà mangiare / niente perché tuti doi le volti sono stati ברכות לבטלה;
  ma bisognava tornare a tor חלה sopra tutta la pasta insieme e non altramente. 


  Ce si havesse domenticata di pigliare חלה in pasta è obligato da poi, quando
  serà coto quel pane o brazolani o fugatie e destenderlo toto sopra una tavola
  e coprirlo con una tovaglia e piglierà la חלה da un pane facendo ברכת להפריש
  חלה come se fusse in / pasta. Se una persona pigliasi della pasta da un
  parente overoיהודי שכן , non si piglia חלה da quela pasta senza sua licenza
  ancora che ti sapesti certo che lor non avessero tolto חלה; perchè la
  obligatione è sua e non tua e la tua ברכה serija לבטלה de modo che facesti
  עוון e non מצוה. Una serva יהודית li sarà lecito a pigliare חלה quando lei
  farà del pane senza / licenza deli sui גברים. Tutte le paste che ce compra da
  li גויים per fare brazolani o fugati o pane o altri מאכלים non si è obligato a
  pigliarne חלה. 


  Quando una bona hebrea vol far pane in casa non bisogna pigliar pasta da גויים
  né da יהודים fora di casa per chè di quela non si pol fare ברכה de חלה perchè
  non è hobligata se non quando / lei properia piglia la farina e impasta e non
  altramente. 


  Ancora bisognia avertire come se impasta la farina per ingrassare בהמות ועופות
  e de quella pasta ne mangierà le persone seijano hobbligatti a levare חלה e
  non altramente. Tute le paste se farà taliatelli overo altre מאכלים cotti nel
  aqua o vero friti nel oglio o nel שומן o butire / ho con la mele, ancora che
  quella pasta fosse assi grande come שיעור חלה, non si è obligato a pigliar חלה
  né a fare ברכה. Ancora cossì quando se farà macaroni e cassete o patè o
  carisone o altri מאכלים quali si cosineranno nel forno overo padela con oglio
  o שומן, tuti questi sij obligate a pigliare חלה e fare ברכה quando serà la
  pasta שיעור חלה e cossi nel forno ma non cotti nel / aqua o altramente.


  Quella farina che sea impastata con la mele o שומן o oglio, con specie o con
  altri misturi quali serano coti nel forno e non friti padela bisogna pigliare
  חלה se sarà stata pasta שעור חלה , facendo ברכה להפריש חלה. Ancora bisognia
  advertire quando se farà dela pasta per fare מאכלים quale serano cote nel aqua
  ho nel brodo senza dollio non serà / obligata a pigliare חלה, salvo se di
  quela pasta si fosse tolta de fare una fugacetta cota sota la cenere o nel
  forno: solamente per quela pocha fugaceta bisognia pigliare חלה e non
  altramente.  


  רבנו האי זצ׳׳ל comandeno che che tute le paste che si farà מאכלים coti per
  minestre sempre ti dé pigliarne un pocheto per / fare la מצוה de la חלה pur
  che sia tuta pasta altramente serija ברכה לבטלה e serija עוון e non מצוה. Il
  יום טוב non si pol sedaçare la farina per fare מאכלים se non per mane di una
  גוייה, ma bisognia voltare il sedatio per fare diferentia al מועד da ali altri
  giorni e cossì non si deve mesurare la farina al יום טוב nè פסח per fare שעור
  חלה, se non pigliarla cossì considerando che sija tanto come sija al שעור חלה;
  e quando se mesurasse la farina / de חול המועד de פסח overo di ערב פסח per
  fare שעור חלה bisognia parlare specificamente e dire: “Questa farina io la
  piglio e la misuro per fare li מצות. La farina che se inpasta di יום טוב
  bisogna pigliare la חלה e non brosarla per fine passato יום טוב, overo cocerla
  subito in modo che non diventa חמץ e darla da mangiare a un נער כהן overo
  נערה: ma altramente non si potrà brusarla per fine passato יום טוב. La חלה che
  si piglia dela pasta de פסח / bisognia che subito si mette nelaqua fredda
  overo cocerla subito in modo che non diventa חמץ facendo ברכה quando serà
  cota, alincontrario delli altri חלות che se fa ברכה subito pigliandola in
  pasta, altramente bisogna da mangiare a un נער o נערה כוהנים picolini o vero
  meterla in aqua freda tenendola per fine / passato  מועדe poi brosarla.

**The _Sefer Mizvot_ from Casale Monferrato (late 16th century)**

The manuscript L. 17 of the Biblioteca Civica in Casale Monferrato, part of the De Conti collection, consists of 91 leaves (lacking the last two). It was transcribed and annotated by Maria Modena Mayer in 1985. Three hands can be identified: (1) ff. 1–38v, likely that of Israel Luria of Padua, whose name appears on the title page; (2) ff. 38v–44v, resembling the Hebrew script of Parma I and linked to a common earlier source; (3) ff. 44v–end, in a later script, copied with the others to form a compendium of women’s three ritual precepts.

Its third section, from which the following excerpt is drawn, compiles ritual rules for the three precepts prescribed to women, similar to previous codices.  It belongs to a production of Judeo-Italian and Italian manuscripts, derived from the _Seder Mitzvot Nashim_ tradition, and features unique hallah and bread recipes absent from other versions. This genre began with a Yiddish work, probably composed in Germany or by German Jews in Italy, that was later adapted in Italy, expanded and published in Poland, and eventually retranslated into Italian. Edward Fram’s _My Dear Daughter_ (2007) includes the annotated translation of Benjamin Slonik’s _Seder mizvot ha-nashim_ (The Order of Women’s Commandments), first published in Cracow in 1577 and later Cracow again (1585, 1595), Basel (1602), and Hanau (1627).  

The manuscript was owned by Ricca (Riccha) Ottolenghi of Villafranca di Verona, who married David Sacerdoti of Pavia in 1586 and later moved with him to Casale Monferrato where they had two children. Ricca was widowed and later remarried in 1603. Her name appears with that of the author/copyist Israel Luria of Padua on the cover page, and she also signed the manuscript with her first husband’s name, suggesting she acquired it between 1586 and her remarriage in 1603. Her possession situates the text within the domestic and devotional life of Jewish women in northern Italy, linking Padua, Verona, Pavia, and Casale. One witness to her wedding, Yaakov Heilprun—rabbi and educator of women—later translated and adapted Slonik’s work into Italian (_Mitzvot Nashim melammedah_, Venice 1616; Padua 1625; Venice 1652, 1711), adding reflections on women’s reading, foods, and household practices, and perhaps even drawing on Ricca’s manuscript. 

The text circulated both within women’s households and across rabbinic networks, revealing a northern Italian nexus where women’s devotional literature and rabbinic learning intersected. Food and cooking practices moved along these same routes, especially those rooted in Venice and northern Italy. It shows a fusion of Italian, Jewish-Italian, and Ashkenazi baking traditions. 

**Sumptuary Laws (Venice 1607)** 

This source contains excerpts on food and banquets from the sumptuary laws issued by the Jewish community of Venice on June 10, 1607, nearly a century after their admission as a body to the city and their confinement to the Ghetto in 1516. At that time, the community found itself caught in a jurisdictional dispute between the _Ufficiali al Cattaver_ and the _Cinque Savii alla Mercanzia_, both seeking authority over them and attempting to impose new restrictions, including changes to the hours of opening the gates of the Ghetto Vecchio and Nuovo, as well as the closing of the gate on the quays. In the same year, on October 3, the Ashkenazi Jews of Venice secured the renewal of their charter—after the previous one had expired on February 28—which permitted their continued residence in the city. Meanwhile, the Levantine and Ponentine Jews were also engaged in diplomatic negotiations with the Venetian government, since their charter was set to expire in August 1608. These developments took place against the broader backdrop of Venice’s struggle with the repercussions of the papal interdict of 1606–1607.

Following a series of regulations enacted by the _Provveditori alle Pompe_—the Venetian officials responsible for monitoring private behavior and consumption—the Jewish community felt compelled to introduce its own rules, urging members to curb expenses and avoid ostentatious displays of wealth. The Small Assembly—the Ghetto’s main governing and legislative body—passed sumptuary provisions recorded in the _Libro Grande_. These measures addressed weddings and private receptions, limiting the number of hot dishes (_vivande_) that could be served to four, likely due to their higher cost and sophistication. These four dishes could be accompanied by customary cold foods, such as “dry meat, tongue, sausages, and other preparations with herbs, along with salads, soups, and dishes made with giblets usually served at such meals.” 

The analysis and the contextualization of this text offer us, on the one hand, a glimpse into the culinary habits of Jews during their most festive celebrations, and on the other, an entry point into the more ordinary foods and everyday kitchens of the segregated Ghetto apartments in Venice.

**Feliciana Diaz’s Testimonies (April 1635)**

In 1635, the New Christian Feliciana Diaz—daughter of the Portuguese converts Odoardo Dias and Clara Teixeira—appeared before the Holy Office in Venice. Her testimony offers a window into the life of an affluent crypto-Jewish family navigating ghettos, churches, taverns, domestic spaces where religious boundaries blurred, and the inquisitorial tribunals themselves. She had faced similar proceedings earlier, in Pisa (1618 and 1626) and Milan (1625). Recently widowed in Florence, she told the Venetian Inquisitors that she had joined her openly Jewish uncle, Josef Senhor, in Venice, insisting that she had always considered herself Catholic while adopting Jewish customs out of necessity and respect. She recounted, too, that she had refused a marriage proposal from her uncle’s brother-in-law, Abram Aboaf, and instead deliberately sought the notice of a window repairman working in her uncle’s home, so that he might bring her case before the tribunal. 

Even through her carefully crafted rhetoric, her testimony reveals practices—such as eating meat on Fridays or during both Jewish and Christian festivals—that could at once affirm New Christian identity and expose practitioners to charges of Judaizing, paralleling, among others, the scrutiny directed at Morisco fasting during Ramadan in sixteenth-century Valencia. Taken together with scattered evidence from other sources, including translations in this collection, her account highlights the blending of Jewish and Mediterranean culinary traditions with Italian styles, linking the kitchens of Jewish families in the Venetian Ghetto to the households of New Christians both within the Ghetto and throughout the city.

**The _Sefer Mitzvot_ from Casale Monferrato (late 16th century)**

Biblioteca di Casale Monferrato, Manuscript L 17, 71r – 78v\*

Advising women that they are not obligated to separate _challah_ (חלה) when making bread unless it is made from one of these five types of flour: for all other kinds of flour, it would be a sin (_avon_ עוון) to separate _challah_ (חלה), and likewise one must not recite the blessing _ha-motzi lechem min ha-aretz_ (ברכת המוציא לחם מן הארץ) \[“Who brings forth bread from the earth”\]. These are the five types of flour for which one is obligated to separate _challah_ (חלה), and for no others: wheat, barley, rye, spelt, and oats. But when any of these five are mixed with other flours, then one is obligated to separate _challah_ (חלה) — and not otherwise. Also, matzot (מצות) for Passover (פסח) may only be made from these five types. For all other flours, there is no obligation to recite the Grace after Meals (_birkat ha-mazon_ ברכת המזון).

You are also advised not to take _challah_ if the dough is small and does not reach the required measure (_shiur_ שעור), because that would be a sin (_avon_ עוון), not a commandment (_mitzvah_ מצוה), and it would result in a blessing in vain (_berakhah le-vatalah_ ברכת לבטלה). For this reason, many women, when kneading dough to make small loaves or pastries (_brazoloni_ ovvero _fugace_), take _challah_ from a small amount of dough, thinking they are performing a _mitzvah_, but in fact they are committing a sin and reciting a blessing in vain (_berakhah le-vatalah_). This is why it is written in our Torah (תורה) what is meant by the _shiur challah_ — the minimum quantity of dough required. Here is how to calculate it: Whoever wants to know precisely what the _shiur challah_ is should take 43 eggs and a fifth, place them into a container (_keli_ כלי) filled level to the top with water, adding the eggs one at a time. Then carefully collect all the water that spills over when these 43 (מ״ג), eggs are inside. Any quantity of flour that, when mixed with the amount of water displaced by these 43 eggs (_mem-gimel beitzim_ מ״ג בצים), creates dough — that is the _shiur challah_, and not otherwise. The word _challah_ also equals forty-three, reinforcing this measure.

If a woman has a batch of dough or leavened starter that was the amount established (ש׳׳ח) and forgot to have _challah_ taken from it, and it was later mixed with another dough from which _challah_ was taken — neither the first nor the second batch may be eaten, since they were mixed together, and it is now necessary to separate _challah_ again from the entire combined dough.  Likewise, if a woman took _challah_ from a batch that met the minimum amount (_shiur challah_), and later made another batch that did not meet the _shiur_ and took _challah_ from it anyway, and then combined the two, nothing may be eaten from the whole, because both blessings were in vain (_berakhot le-vatalah_), and one must now separate _challah_ from the entire dough together, and only then can it be eaten.

If someone forgot to take _challah_ from the dough, they are obligated to do so after small loaves or focaccias (_brazolani_ or _fugatie_) have been baked. In this case, all the bread must be spread out on a table and covered with a cloth, and then _challah_ must be taken from one loaf, saying the blessing “le-hafrish challah” (להפריש חלה) \[“to separate challah”\], as if it were still dough.  If a person receives dough from a relative or a Jewish neighbor (_yehudi shachen יהודי שכן_), one must not take _challah_ from that dough without their permission, even if you are certain they themselves did not take _challah_, because the obligation is theirs, not yours — and your blessing would be in vain, making it a sin (_avon_), not a mitzvah.  A Jewish maid (_yehudit יהודית_) may take _challah_ when she bakes bread, even without the permission of her masters (_gvarim גברים_). All the doughs purchased from Gentiles (_goyim גויים_) for making small loaves or focaccias or breads of other foods (_ma’akhalim מאכלים_) are not subject to the obligation of taking _challah_.

When a good Jewish woman wants to bake bread at home, she must not use dough from Gentiles or Jews outside her home, because she cannot recite the blessing of _challah_ on dough she did not prepare herself. The obligation applies only when she herself takes the flour and kneads it, not otherwise.

Also, note that when dough is made for fattening animals or birds (_behemot ve’ofot בהמות ועופות_), and people later eat from that dough, they are obligated to take _challah_, but only in that case, not otherwise. All doughs made into noodles (_tagliatelle_) or other foods (_ma’akhalim_) that are boiled in water, or fried in oil, fat (_shuman_), butter, or honey, even if the amount of dough exceeds the _shiur challah_, are not obligated in _challah_ nor in the blessing.  However, when one makes macarons and pâtés in a crust, or cakes with flour and almonds, or other foods baked in the oven or in a pan with oil or fat, then these are obligated to take the _challah_ and the blessing must be made, if the dough meets the _shiur challah_— when baked in the oven, but not if boiled in water or cooked otherwise.

Flour mixed with honey, fat (_shuman_), oil, spices, or other mixtures and baked in the oven, not fried in a pan, does require _challah_ to be taken if it is _shiur challah_, along with the blessing “le-hafrish challah”.  Also, be aware that if dough is made for foods to be boiled in water or broth, and no oil is added, one is not obligated to take _challah_ — unless some of that dough is used to make a small focaccia baked under ashes or in the oven. In that case, only that small focaccia requires _challah_ to be taken, and not the rest.

Our Rabbi Hai (Rabbenu Hai זצ״ל) commanded that for all doughs made into cooked foods (_ma’akhalim_) for soups, one should always separate a small portion to fulfill the mitzvah of _challah_, as long as it is all one dough. Otherwise, it would be a blessing in vain (_berakhah le-vatalah_) and a sin (_avon_), not a mitzvah (_mitzvah_). On Yom Tov (יום טוב), flour must not be sifted for preparing food except by the hand of a Gentile woman (_goyah_ גוייה), and the sifter must be turned upside down to differentiate the holiday from other days. Likewise, flour should not be measured on Yom Tov and Passover (Pesach פסח) in order to reach the _shiur challah_; instead, it should be taken approximately, estimating that it equals the required measure. When flour is measured on Chol ha-Mo’ed of Pesach (חול המועד דפסח) or Erev Pesach (ערב פסח) to meet the _shiur challah_, one must say aloud: “This flour I take and measure to make the _matzot_.” Dough kneaded on Yom Tov requires that _challah_ be taken, but it must not be burned until Yom Tov is over — unless it is baked immediately so that it does not become leavened (_chametz חמץ_), and then fed to a young Kohen boy or girl (_na’ar Kohen נער כהן or na’arah נערה_). Otherwise, it must be placed in cold water and kept until after the holiday, and then burned. The _challah_ taken from Passover dough must be immediately put in cold water or baked at once so it doesn’t become chametz, and the blessing should be made when it is baked. This is unlike other _challot_, for which the blessing is made immediately upon separating the dough. Otherwise, one must feed it to a young Kohen boy or girl, or place it in cold water until after the holiday, and then burn it.

**Sumptuary Laws (Venice 1607)**

Archivio di Stato di Venezia, Ufficiali al Cattaver, Folder 242, Libro Grande dell’Università degli Ebrei, 52v-57v.\*

At wedding celebrations or marriage feasts, it shall not be permitted to invite or call any other people except those who are _pesulim le’edut_ (a transliteration of פסולים לעדות), of the bride or groom, and their fathers and mothers. If the number of these _pesulim_ does not reach 20 (men and women combined), then additional people may be invited up to that total number of 20 (men and women combined), but no more. This excludes the _ḥazzan_ (cantor) and _shamash_ (sexton) of the synagogue of that _kahal_ (community) where the celebration is held, and the _shamash_ of the _kehillot_ (congregations). At _berit milah_ (circumcision) feasts, no more than 15 men and women combined may be invited, whether they are _pesulim_ or not, so long as the total does not exceed 15.

At such meals, no more than four types of dishes may be served, not counting preserved dried meats, tongues, sausages, other savory items, and salads, soups, and dishes made from offal that are customarily included in meals. Each type of food mentioned is to be counted as one dish: poultry, meat, fish, or cheese. If two types of poultry or meat are served (boiled or roasted), they will count as two dishes. The same applies to fish and cheese. If one type of meat, poultry, or fish is prepared in multiple ways, each preparation counts as a separate dish.

Fruit may be served in any quantity and kind, but confections may only include _mandorle confetti_ (sugar-coated almonds), or pine nuts and coriander seeds mixed on a single plate. Alternatively, marzipan may be substituted. In addition to these, one plate of _anise confetti_ may be served.  At _Spinolz_ (Shabbat or two before the wedding), _vigilia_ (the evening before circumcision), _visita di parto_ (a woman’s visit to the synagogue after childbirth for the _birkat ha-gomel_ blessing), or other customary gatherings at the _chevrot_ (confraternities), as well as during weddings, circumcisions, or similar occasions, only the following may be served: _storti_ (wafer shells filled with whipped cream), _bozzolai_ (sugared biscuits into a ring or a S shape), _fargazzette_ (small focaccias), and common fruits or confections. No other type of preserved fruit or fancy confections of any kind may be served, with no exceptions.

Likewise, no gift of any preserved confection may be sent on any occasion, except that at weddings, sugared almonds (_confetti_) may be sent to the _pesulim_ who are permitted to be invited, as explained above. On the third day after a _berit milah_, marzipan may be sent to those who attended the meal, and no one else.  On the Shabbat when a mother (whether of a male or female child) returns to synagogue after childbirth, no gifts may be sent to anyone, except to _pesulim_ as above. Foreigners who come to Venice for weddings, circumcision receptions, or other festive celebrations (_allegrezze_) may be invited, and they will not be counted among the limited numbers mentioned above.  During the three days before Purim, on Purim itself (both days), and for three days after, no gifts may be sent to any person except to parents, children, brothers, sisters, and up to three friends—no more. As for wine, _malvasia_ (a sweet wine), or similar, they may be sent in any quantity desired.

In the case of a death, no woman of any status or rank may go to the cemetery unless she is the deceased’s wife, mother, sister, daughter, or daughter-in-law. Alongside her, three other women may accompany her. If the deceased is a woman and has no close female relatives as described, then three women may go, regardless of their status, whether relatives or friends.

All those invited—whether to joyful or mournful occasions—must ensure that these orders are strictly observed. In particular, those invited to meals must be diligent in ensuring these rules are kept during the celebrations, in terms of the number of invitees and the foods served. Otherwise, they are obliged, under penalty of _cherem_ (excommunication), to leave and not eat at the meal or gathering. Such disobedience would be considered as grave as eating forbidden meat (_nevelah u’treifah_, נתילה וטריפה).

**Feliciana Diaz’s Testimonies**

Archivio di Stato di Venezia, Inquisitori di Stato, Processi, Folder 92, cc. 16.\* The Latin sentences are in Italics.

**Testimony from April 12, 1635**

_And next appeared the woman who is said to have been taken from that house, who is a young woman of about 22 years of age, as could be seen, etc. Dressed in the Florentine style, with a fair and rosy round face, with black hair on her head, of medium height, and speaking Florentine, as could be heard, etc. She was immediately asked about her name, surname, birthplace, parents, age, and residence, and she replied_: “My name is Feliciana Diaz, born in Pisa, daughter of the late Odoardo Diaz, a Spanish Christian, and the late Clara Tessera, a Portuguese crypto-Jew, married couple. I am 24 years old. I have been a widow for about a year, and I only had one husband who lived with me for just two years, and his name was Francesco de Biguria, a Spanish Christian merchant in Florence.”

Asked how long she had been in Venice, _she replied_: “Last night made one month.”

Asked how she came to be in Venice, _she replied_: “I was summoned by an uncle of mine, a Jew who lives in the ghetto, named Gioseffo Signori, a Portuguese, who lives in the Ghetto Nuovo. His house is located above a canal across from a Christian noblewoman, and this Gioseffo is my maternal uncle.” \[…\]

Asked whether she had presented herself in any way as a Jew or as a Christian, _she replied_: “As a Jewess, in all the places where I have been.” \[…\] “From the time I started taking the sacraments, I lived as a Christian because I said my Christian prayers and ate all kinds of food except for meat on Fridays and Saturdays.”

Asked whether she ate in the company of Jews or alone, _she replied_: “I had a room to myself in the house of Giacob Vicino in Ferrara, and I always ate alone there. His servant, Dolce, brought me the food.” Asked what kinds of food were brought to her on Fridays, Saturdays, vigils, and during Lent in Ferrara, _she replied_: “From Friday and Saturday onwards, I did not eat meat. On other days, I ate all sorts of food and did not observe Lent because among those Jews in Ferrara I did not declare myself to be a Christian.”

\[…\] Asked how her mother had lived, having earlier said she was a crypto-Jew, that is, whether she lived as a Jew or a Christian, _she replied_: “Publicly, that is outwardly, as a Christian, out of respect for her husband, my father, who was a Christian.” Asked whether during her time in Venice she had presented herself as a Christian or as a crypto-Jew, that is, whether she lived as a Jew or a Christian, _she replied_: “In the ghetto, I passed as a Jewess.” Asked whether she had ever said she was a Jew or a Christian, _she replied_: “I never said I was a Jewess, but since the Jews saw me entering the ghetto and staying with my uncle, they commonly considered me a Jewess.” Asked whether during her time in Venice she had lived as a Jew or a Christian, she replied: “I lived as I did in Ferrara—that is, I said Christian prayers and the prayers of the dead, and I ate meat except on Fridays and Saturdays.” Asked whether she ate during this Lent in Venice in the company of Jews, she replied: “I ate with my uncle’s wife because he was ill.” Asked whether her uncle or his wife knew that she was a Christian, she replied: “They knew I was a Christian, and they knew because he was my mother’s brother and letters frequently passed between Venice and Pisa. He wrote to me as a Christian.” \[…\] 

A man whose name she did not know, a glazier in Venice (that is, a window-fixer), had come into my uncle’s house to fix a window, sometime before the Passover and before Christian Easter Sunday. Asked what conversation took place between her and the glazier, _she replied_: “My uncle’s wife told me to stay in that room to watch over the silverware, which was out in the open. The glazier asked me whether I was married, seeing that my hair was uncut. I told him I had been married in Florence without saying anything else and that I was not a Jewess.”

**Testimony from April 17, 1635**

When asked whether, during the past Lent (Quadragesima) in Ferrara and also in Venice, she had eaten meat because she was unwell and had been advised by a doctor to do so, _she replied_: “I ate it because I was among Jews in those places and did not want to offend them, as I was passing myself off as a Jewess. I ate it even though I was healthy.” 

When asked whether the Jews in whose house she had stayed had encouraged or forced her to eat meat during that Lent, _she replied_: “No, gentlemen.” _And when told that it did not seem believable_ that the Jews had not at least encouraged or urged her to eat meat, given that she herself said she did it to avoid displeasing them, _she replied_: “They did not force or pressure me to eat meat. I did it because I thought it would displease them if they had to make special food just for me.”  
  
When asked whether she believed it was permissible to enter the homes of Jews, particularly in the ghettos, and to live among them, and to in any way declare oneself a Jew, _she replied_: “I know it was wrong, and I entered \[their homes\] because at that time I had no sense. If I had, I would not have entered, nor would I have done what I did.”  When asked whether she believed it was permissible to eat meat and other foods forbidden to Christians, without any medical necessity but only so as not to offend the Jews, she replied: “I believed it was not right to do so, but I ate it thinking that I would have to live and die with my uncle.”  

_And when told_ that this answer contradicted a previous statement in another examination, where she said she had always wished and tried, as much as she could, to escape from the hands of the Jews to live as a Christian, _she replied_: “My intention was always to leave the Jews and live as a Christian, as I said in the first examination. But if it had not turned out as I hoped— and I was also freed without expecting it——I would have stayed in my uncle’s house and, as a result, lived like the Jews.” When asked what she now intended to do, _she replied_: “To return to my home.”  

When asked whether she had any belongings in Venice in the hands of the Jews, _she replied_: “My uncle has everything. That is, I have nothing in Venice, but in Florence I entrusted everything, by order of my uncle, to Emanuel Vagez, who is in Florence.”
