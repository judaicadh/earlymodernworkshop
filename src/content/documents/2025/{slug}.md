The preparation of kosher meat was central to Jewish self-identity and religious life in the early modern period. While the ritual slaughter of fowl was relatively simple and was often done by individuals in isolated communities, butchering large animals was another matter. Even after a steer or heifer had been hoisted and correctly slaughtered, its lungs had to be examined for adhesions (_sirkot_). The concern was that an adhesion covered a hole in the lung, and it was assumed that an animal with a perforation in the lung would not survive. If so, the animal was a _tereyfah_, an animal with a terminal sickness, and prohibited. This made probing the lungs contentious, for even a small perforation rendered an entire animal unfit for consumption and caused substantial financial loss. Moreover, in an age in which food was seasonal and sometimes scarce, it prevented people from finding sustenance. 

The entire matter of rubbing, detaching, and dissolving adhesions in the lungs of large animals is arguably one of the most significant allowances in the canon of Jewish law. This was not a new development, for it was said to have been the widespread practice among Jewish communities in the German lands in the late thirteenth century. However, it stood in stark contrast to the views of Sephardic authorities throughout the ages. Caro and Isserles present different opinions on the practice. Isserles himself describes local customs that differed from his thoughts. This leniency offers a prism to reconsider the paradigm of Ashkenazic Jewry not maximizing legal allowances.
