A conflict emerged in the 1590s over the issue of Jewish alcohol production and sale between Lublin Jews and the burghers of Podzamcze, the suburb where the Lublin Jewish community lived. Podzamcze, whose name in Polish means “under the castle,” was under the private jurisdiction of the Lublin starosta, a royal official based in the castle who was responsible for the Lublin castle court, among other official functions in and around Lublin. 

Podzamcze burghers insisted that alcohol production and sale was their exclusive right, while Lublin Jews argued that their privileges allowed it. Representatives of Podzamcze’s burgher community began appearing before the Lublin castle court in 1593 with complaints that members of the Lublin Jewish community were illegally brewing and selling alcohol. These lawsuits came after the burghers of Podzamcze had won their own rights to brew and sell alcohol, which had been contested as the exclusive rights of the burghers of Lublin itself. 

The lawsuits of the Podzamcze burghers named the Lublin Jewish community as the defendants—a common practice in this period. Indeed, the lawsuits were being filed on behalf of the government of Podzamcze. Frequent recurring lawsuits had no demonstrable effect, as the individual Jews who were named in the suits as being the ones to engage in this practice were observed violating the decisions of the courts on many occasions by functionaries of the castle court, who served as official witnesses. The Lublin Jewish community justified this by arguing that the privileges given to them allowed Jews to engage in the alcohol trade, while the Podzamcze burghers defended their hard-won rights to exclusive alcohol production and sale in Podzamcze. 

The first document under consideration, “Polish State Archive in Lublin (APL), Castrensia Lublinensia: relationes, manifestationes et oblatae (CLRMO) 29, 632–633v,” is a report by the starosta of Lublin on his decision to establish a commission tasked with reviewing the privileges of both the Lublin Jewish community and burghers of Podzamcze. Ultimately, the commission established a compromise that would fit both the dietary restrictions of Lublin Jews, while protecting the Podzamcze burghers’ monopoly of most alcohol production and sale in the city. Lublin Jews were allowed produce and sell wine to other Jews and buy barrels of beer from burghers to sell smaller amounts to Jews but were forbidden from other alcohol production and sale. Despite this, Lublin Jews continued to produce and sell alcohol beyond the limits of the compromise, and the matter escalated further. 

The second document, a copy of the 1596 decision of the Royal Assessors’ Court, was written in the name of King Sigismund III Vasa. It decided Podzamcze burghers’ lawsuit against the Jewish community of Lublin was invalid, since illegal brewing was “customarily done by individuals,” rather than the community as a whole. This decision referred future infractions to be tried at lower competent courts for each offense. A separate case from the Royal Assessors’ Court sentenced named individual Jews to hefty fines, though the principle that the Jewish community could not be held responsible for this appeared to be a large win for the Lublin Jewish community.
