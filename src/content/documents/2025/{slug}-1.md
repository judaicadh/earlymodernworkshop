<h2 style="text-align: center">Introduction</h2>

_Bedikah_ and _nikkur_ as part of kosher meat production show great diversity due to the influences of local or regional _minhagim_. Furthermore, they can also become part of a communal identity and serve as protection against external influences. In this context, women can express their ritual role and identity by affirming local practices and even performing _nikkur_.

A striking example of this is a collection of responsa written in Bonn in 1616, which documents a special form of _bedikah_ as part of a lenient _minhag_ (Bodleian Library Oxford, Oppenheim 328; NLI Jerusalem, Ms. heb. 8° 2241; Det kongelige Bibliotek Kopenhagen, Cod. Sim. Hebr. 97; printed in Mordechai Halberstadt, _Maamar mordechai_, Brno 1790, fol. 39d-45a, No. 30). When the new provincial rabbi wanted to abolish this minhag, he met with fierce resistance, which referred to the established meticulous practice in which women were also involved: “Women with experience, whose hearts He \[God\] has raised in wisdom, porged (_menakkrin_) the outside of the stomach.”

As a result, the _minhag_ remained in place until the 19th century, but was regarded as a local peculiarity in the Electorate of Cologne, which repeatedly sparked controversy. In addition to its halachic function, the collection of responsa was also significant for the politics of memory. For the respected (_katzin_) Juda bar Chayyim from Bonn, in whose house the controversial ritual slaughter and meat inspection had once taken place, was none other than the notorious “traitor Loeb Kraus” of the Frankfurt ordinances of 1603. Denounced by his Jewish opponents in his office as “supervisor” of the Jews of the Electorate of Cologne, he in turn denounced the decrees of 1604 to the Elector as high treason. With the minhag documented in the collection of responsa, his followers erected a monument to him as a benefactor.
