(Doc. 1) The _Apologie_ by Zalkind Hourwitz (1751-1812; born in Poland, resident in France from 1774; author, interpreter at Bibliothèque Royale 1789-92, activist), was one of the three prize winners in the 1788 Metz Academy competition “Are there means to render the Jews more useful and happier in France?” 

Discussions of the Jews’ status and condition were part of broader debates about citizenship and community on the eve and early years of the Revolution.  Oft-ignored in studies of Jewish struggles to prove themselves fit for legal equality was the attention paid to Jewish food and foodways.  For the French, _la table_—what did one eat and with whom?—was politically consequential.  What could Jewish dietary laws and eating practices mean for sociability, fraternity, community, belonging to the French nation, becoming French citizens?

Hourwitz explicitly countered the claims of Michaelis, Voltaire and Rousseau that religious law made the Jews “unsociable” and their customs “incompatible” with others by addressing these issues: (1) what foods were permitted and prohibited to Jews?;  (2) with whom could Jews eat?; (3) did their dietary laws and marriage patterns foster Jewish “misanthropy”?; (4) did their distinctive foods affect Jews physically? (5) were Jews unique in having distinctive eating practices?

I include three other complementary views: (Doc. 2) Comte de Mirabeau (1787) and (Doc. 3) Abbé Grégoire (1789; _contra_ his earlier negative views)—both of whom denied that different groups’ diverse eating practices should have political consequences; and (Doc. 4) Jews of Paris, Alsace and Lorraine to the French National Assembly (1790), who denied that Jewish eating practices would impair French citizenship and promoted other ways of forging social and civic ties. 

Among my questions: Why were Jewish food and foodways so sensitive? How might civil, secular ideas of sociability, community, fraternity, and citizenship rest on age-old notions of Holy Communion?
