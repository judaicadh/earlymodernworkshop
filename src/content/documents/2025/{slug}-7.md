  How carefully did Jewish individuals observe halakhic requirements regarding
  kashrut, and how strictly did Jewish communities enforce them? Such questions
  seem pivotal when we consider a community such as that of Pisa/Livorno, newly
  established in the 1590s and overwhelmingly composed of, and led by,
  Portuguese conversos only recently arrived from the Iberian Peninsula. After
  all, these Jews had been living outwardly Christian lives for almost a
  century. How quickly did they accommodate, for example, the new rules of food
  consumption? How were such rules justified? And how effectively could they be
  enforced? While halakhic codes paint an idealized picture of uniform
  conformity, the deliberations and decisions of communal lay leaders point at a
  more complex reality and a less straightforward acceptance. We shall examine
  three separate rulings by the _Massari_ of Pisa/Livorno between 1606 and 1616,
  in order to explore these questions. 


  Our exploration of these specific cases and the mechanics of communal
  authority may lead us to broader considerations:


  1.  The relation between an official rhetoric and “lived religion.”
      
  2.  The particular effectiveness of food regulation in establishing group
  identity.
      
  3.  The effort in these early-modern Jewish communities to establish (or
  invent) what is religiously acceptable in comparison with what occurred in
  Jewish communities elsewhere, for example in Poland which Moshe Rosman labeled
  “innovative tradition.”
      
  4.  The relative roles of lay and rabbinic authority in these newly
  institutionalized communities, and the role that halakha played in community
  discipline.
