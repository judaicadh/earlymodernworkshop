<h2 style="text-align: center">Introduction</h2>

**Pinkas Pisa, Volume 1: Central Archive for the History of the Jewish People, Film HM 887**

How carefully did Jewish individuals observe halakhic requirements regarding kashrut, and how strictly did Jewish communities enforce them? Such questions seem pivotal when we consider a community such as that of Pisa/Livorno, newly established in the 1590s and overwhelmingly composed of, and led by, Portuguese conversos only recently arrived from the Iberian Peninsula. After all, these Jews had been living outwardly Christian lives for almost a century. How quickly did they accommodate, for example, the new rules of food consumption? How were such rules justified? And how effectively could they be enforced? While halakhic codes paint an idealized picture of uniform conformity, the deliberations and decisions of communal lay leaders point at a more complex reality and a less straightforward acceptance. We shall examine three separate rulings by the _Massari_ of Pisa/Livorno between 1606 and 1616, in order to explore these questions. 

Our exploration of these specific cases and the mechanics of communal authority may lead us to broader considerations:

1.  The relation between an official rhetoric and “lived religion.”
    
2.  The particular effectiveness of food regulation in establishing group identity.
    
3.  The effort in these early-modern Jewish communities to establish (or invent) what is religiously acceptable in comparison with what occurred in Jewish communities elsewhere, for example in Poland which Moshe Rosman labeled “innovative tradition.”
    
4.  The relative roles of lay and rabbinic authority in these newly institutionalized communities, and the role that halakha played in community discipline.

**Pinkas Pisa —Volume 1. CAHJP, Film  HM 887, fol. 85v.**

In Pisa on the 32nd day of the Omer, in the year 5376

The members of the _ma'amad_ \[council\] together with the Haham\[^1\] Azariah Picho and the accompanying members to the number of ten order that no Jew of whatever quality or condition whatsoever may take \[i.e., purchase\] meat in any way, for himself or others, nor may he order \[someone else to\] take in any fashion meat from any butcher shop or any other place outside of our butcher shop, whether it is known to be kosher or not, whether or not in the company of the ritual slaughterer. This does not apply to meat from the head or ribs \[?\] or other internal organs \[_de meudo_—in modern usage, “tripe”\] that is not liable for the _quattrino_ \[a small coin\] for the communal charity fund. The reference to tripe is meant to refer to kosher meat. 

The punishment for anyone who takes such meat from outside our butcher shop as above in any possible way is that of _herem, nidui_ and _sematha_ \[various levels of excommunication, here collected for emphasis\]. The same punishment will be applied to anyone who sees any Jew taking meat as above and does not come to testify within two days, that he will be declared as “_hermado_” \[under a decree of excommunication\]. This being noted, the members of the _maamad_ will be obliged to publish it, and no Jew may engage in commerce with him, nor communicate with him. All of the said men \[of the _ma’amad_\] shall send and order such that no one will incur the danger \[_hiero_\] of eating non-kosher meat by mistake \[_carne trefe por cazer_\] and other misadventures, may they not occur \[_que nisto poden aconteser \[i.e., acontecer\]_\], and also so that the public charity fund will not lose any of the money from the _quattrino_ for meat which is collected at its order, as well as for other reasons considered by those men. 

Similarly, they further order that no _bodek_ \[Hebrew: person who checks, equivalent to modern kashrut supervisor called a _mashgiah_\]\] or anyone else may store, or cause to be stored, meat outside the communal butcher shop. So that no one complains \[_quexar_\] and to avoid scandals and troubles that may henceforth arise. 

They order that this ruling be announced from the reader's desk of the sacred synagogue on a day when the Torah \[is read in public\], so that it becomes known to everyone. Further it should be read and publicized together with the other _escamos_ \[rulings; literally, “agreements”\] that they further prohibit and order. 

They sign their names in Pisa.

\[Patronizing Non-Jewish Taverns; Drinking Non-Jews’ Wine\]

In the name of God, Pisa, 19 of the month of Shevat of the year 5373, February 10, 1612 according to the Florentine calendar.\[^2\]

The members of the _ma'amad_ \[council\] together with the accompanying members together with the Haham \[^3\] Azaria Picho to the number of a _minyan,_\[^4\] all signed below.

They have observed the waste and great scandals that occur and are created in many ways by Jews going to eat and drink in the taverns and houses of _goyim_ \[Hebrew: gentiles\]. They \[therefore\] order and command that from today forward, no Jew, whether adult or a minor, whether married or single, or a woman, whether a Jew with _goyim,_ or a Jew with another Jew,  or a Jew alone, under pain of _nidui, herem_ and _shmata_ \[categories of excommunication\], and a fine of ten ducats, half for the redemption of Jewish slaves \[or: captives\] of His Most Serene Highness \[the Grand Duke of Tuscany\] and the other half  to be applied to the _sedaca_ \[charity fund\] of this _escola_ \[community\] for each time they do the opposite. If there are two Jews together or more who do this and one should quickly accuse the other, the accuser is absolved. Any Jew who sees or has knowledge, and any Jew or Jewess who has gone to such places for these reasons \[_efeitos—_literally, effects\], is obligated within twenty-four hours to come \[_villo_\] to inform the members of the _maamad_ then in office, and those officials have the duty to act on it. It is declared that any Jew can freely try the said wine for the sole purpose of carrying it back to their house. And it is declared that any person who is or goes on the road may eat and drink in those non-local \[_de fora_\] hostelries, although they may not leave the city for that purpose to eat and drink in those hostelries, under the above-mentioned penalty. All of this is to be observed correctly and truthfully, without being able to sanction any of the above through any deception or trick. If any word should be missing or be extra \[_soubejar_\] in this _haskama_ \[ruling\] all shall be understood as strengthening and enlarging this _haskama_ \[^5\]. Thus did they approve and order and they signed their names. And I, David Abenine, _sofer_ \[scribe\], have written at the command of the said Officers on that day and year.

\[^5\] This is quite unusual language for the _pinkas_ and may relate back to the standard ending inserted to confirming the authenticity Hebrew legal documents: והכל שריר וקיים.

\[Cheese Not Prepared by Jews\]

B”H\[^1\]

In Pisa, \[Sunday,\] 16 July, 5366.\[^2\]

The members of the _ma'amad_ \[council\] together with the accompanying members being gathered and Master Haham\[^3\] Semuel Chajes totaling ten, order:

Seeing the so great sin which is incurred in eating cheese not made by the hand of a Jew as well as \[_poinas_ _e leito_\], they were in agreement and the vote was taken and it came out unanimously in favor. Then \[?\] they discussed the penalty that such eating deserved for contravening the words of our Sages of blessed memory. The said officials ordered that the punishment of excommunication \[_niduy_\] with all of its severity be imposed, and that this be publicized on the first day on which the Scroll of the Law \[is taken out to be read in the synagogue\] \[^4\] so that after the publication, anyone who transgresses that _niduy,_ there being witnesses, shall be immediately publicly declared as _menude._ All the measures applied to the _menude_ should be applied to him. And if he eats covertly the ban will enter his bones since he would be motivated and is motivated. All of the curses written in the book of the Law apply to him. Thus they order and rule today, the said day and month and year mentioned above, _ve-shalom al ha-peturim_ \[and peace be upon the innocent\]. And I, David Abenine, _sofer,_ have written by order of the said officials. David Abenine.

\[The said _niduy_ regarding cheese is withdrawn\]

On 18 Tishre, 5368\[^5\]

The members of the _ma’amad_ being present, as well as the greater part of this Holy Congregation, and among them the Haham Semuel Hajes, it was voted on whether the punishment of _niduy_ imposed above concerning cheese should, or should not, be lifted. The vote was taken. The results were 18 votes that it should be lifted and 10 that it not be lifted. For that reason, noting that the _kahal_ was content and voted, the said _niduy_ is removed_,_ and it remains to be observed as before the imposition of that punishment. 

And I, David Abenine, _sofer,_ have written. David Abenine.
