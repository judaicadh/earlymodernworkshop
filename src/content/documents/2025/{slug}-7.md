**Pinkas Pisa, Volume 1: Central Archive for the History of the Jewish People, Film HM 887**

How carefully did Jewish individuals observe halakhic requirements regarding kashrut, and how strictly did Jewish communities enforce them? Such questions seem pivotal when we consider a community such as that of Pisa/Livorno, newly established in the 1590s and overwhelmingly composed of, and led by, Portuguese conversos only recently arrived from the Iberian Peninsula. After all, these Jews had been living outwardly Christian lives for almost a century. How quickly did they accommodate, for example, the new rules of food consumption? How were such rules justified? And how effectively could they be enforced? While halakhic codes paint an idealized picture of uniform conformity, the deliberations and decisions of communal lay leaders point at a more complex reality and a less straightforward acceptance. We shall examine three separate rulings by the _Massari_ of Pisa/Livorno between 1606 and 1616, in order to explore these questions. 

Our exploration of these specific cases and the mechanics of communal authority may lead us to broader considerations:

1.  The relation between an official rhetoric and “lived religion.”
    
2.  The particular effectiveness of food regulation in establishing group identity.
    
3.  The effort in these early-modern Jewish communities to establish (or invent) what is religiously acceptable in comparison with what occurred in Jewish communities elsewhere, for example in Poland which Moshe Rosman labeled “innovative tradition.”
    
4.  The relative roles of lay and rabbinic authority in these newly institutionalized communities, and the role that halakha played in community discipline.

In Pisa on the 32nd day of the Omer, in the year 5376

The members of the _ma'amad_ \[council\] together with the Haham\[^1\] Azariah Picho and the accompanying members to the number of ten order that no Jew of whatever quality or condition whatsoever may take \[i.e., purchase\] meat in any way, for himself or others, nor may he order \[someone else to\] take in any fashion meat from any butcher shop or any other place outside of our butcher shop, whether it is known to be kosher or not, whether or not in the company of the ritual slaughterer. This does not apply to meat from the head or ribs \[?\] or other internal organs \[_de meudo_—in modern usage, “tripe”\] that is not liable for the _quattrino_ \[a small coin\] for the communal charity fund. The reference to tripe is meant to refer to kosher meat. 

The punishment for anyone who takes such meat from outside our butcher shop as above in any possible way is that of _herem, nidui_ and _sematha_ \[various levels of excommunication, here collected for emphasis\]. The same punishment will be applied to anyone who sees any Jew taking meat as above and does not come to testify within two days, that he will be declared as “_hermado_” \[under a decree of excommunication\]. This being noted, the members of the _maamad_ will be obliged to publish it, and no Jew may engage in commerce with him, nor communicate with him. All of the said men \[of the _ma’amad_\] shall send and order such that no one will incur the danger \[_hiero_\] of eating non-kosher meat by mistake \[_carne trefe por cazer_\] and other misadventures, may they not occur \[_que nisto poden aconteser \[i.e., acontecer\]_\], and also so that the public charity fund will not lose any of the money from the _quattrino_ for meat which is collected at its order, as well as for other reasons considered by those men. 

Similarly, they further order that no _bodek_ \[Hebrew: person who checks, equivalent to modern kashrut supervisor called a _mashgiah_\]\] or anyone else may store, or cause to be stored, meat outside the communal butcher shop. So that no one complains \[_quexar_\] and to avoid scandals and troubles that may henceforth arise. 

They order that this ruling be announced from the reader's desk of the sacred synagogue on a day when the Torah \[is read in public\], so that it becomes known to everyone. Further it should be read and publicized together with the other _escamos_ \[rulings; literally, “agreements”\] that they further prohibit and order. 

They sign their names in Pisa.
