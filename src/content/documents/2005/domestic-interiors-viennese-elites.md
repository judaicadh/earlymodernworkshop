The probate inventories of mid-eighteenth-century Viennese Court Jews provide a rare opportunity to reflect upon the role of material consumption in the processes of acculturation and class formation among Central European Jewish elites during the decades preceding the Haskalah (Jewish Enlightenment). Probate inventories are lists of assets and possessions drawn up by government officials in the process of settling the estate of the deceased. These inventories require cautious interpretation by the historian, but potentially yield precious rewards since they afford a glimpse into the individual’s complex material world.

Court Jews exerted an important influence on the gradual opening of German Jewry to outside society and culture. For on thing, many Court Jews’ in major cities like Berlin and Vienna adopted changes in lifestyle that reflected the cultural impact of their close contact with the Christian elites whom they encountered in their dealings at German courts. The documents presented here demonstrate how urban Court Jews and their families began to create domestic environments resembling those of the Christian nobility and wealthy bourgeoisie. Recently historians have begun to recognize that the consumption of goods is about more than fulfilling essential bodily needs, but rather the goods people use communicate values and social choices. Thus, examining the consumption patterns of Court Jews offers insight into the mentalité of Court Jew society in a way that more traditional documentary evidence does not. One should be careful not assume that these Jews were simply communicating a desire to integrate into Christian society, which was a distinctly nineteenth-century German-Jewish aspiration. Rather, the evidence here forces us to confront the complex motivations behind their choices of consumption as they negotiated between two worlds.

The first inventory represents the home of Judith Oppenheimer (1671 - 1738), widow of Emanuel Oppenheimer (1657 – 1721) and the daughter-in-law of Samuel Oppenheimer, the first Court Jew to resettle in Vienna after the expulsion of the Jews in 1670. Judith’s husband Emanuel inherited his father’s contract to supply Emperor Leopold I’s military and upon Emanuel’s death in 1721, Judith took control of her husband’s firm and kept it afloat for nearly 17 years. By the time Judith died in 1738 she had fallen into debt; nevertheless her probate inventory contains a detailed description of her richly appointed apartment. The text and translation do no represent Judith’s entire lengthy inventory, but rather a majority of the material possessions described.

The second inventory is that of Isaac Nathan Oppenheimer (1679 – 1739), the stepson of the famous Court Jews Samuel Wertheimer. Although Isaac does not appear officially to have held the title “Court Jew”, he was a successful financier with connections to the Imperial Treasury and was also related by marriage to and important Court Jew family.
