<h2 style="text-align: center">Introduction</h2>

The Early Modern Period, an era of “confessionalization,” provides numerous examples of individuals of immediate, distant, feigned, or merely imputed Jewish origin whose religious and social allegiances shifted radically. The phenomenon of Iberian New Christians or _conversos_ comes to mind. Early modern Jews who became Christians but who, unlike _conversos_, possessed no personal and familial background in Christianity constitute an allied field of research (See examples in the Bibliography, below). Scholarly assessments of the ways in which these Jewish non-conversos learned and influenced their adopted Christian culture(s) often concentrate on intellectual production. The focus is not surprising, as the converts under discussion were usually educated individuals to whom Christian patrons often assigned prominent roles as anti-Jewish polemicists and missionaries. By contrast to the apologetic works and other religious writings of and about such converts, the texts presented here offer glimpses of the experience of uneducated, relatively inarticulate people of very modest material means who found themselves at a crossroads between Jewish (or Jewish-identified) and Hispano-Catholic identities, and whose formal cultural realignment caused no historical ripple.

The folios selected for this workshop comprise large excerpts of two inquisitorial cases dating from the early 1790s. Both dossiers are relatively brief and fragmentary. I offer them together in order to provide more analytical possibilities than each of the documents would offer by itself.

In each of the cases, a lone deponent appeared "spontaneously" before the Toledo Tribunal of the Spanish Holy Office to express a desire to renounce Judaism, undergo baptism, and be received into “the bosom” of the Roman Catholic Church. Each of the two declarants—a petty merchant and widow from Hesse-Cassel, and a carpenter from Mantua—dimly related or merely hinted of various informal social interactions. May we approach the latter as informal processes and avenues of Jewish and, to a greater extent, Hispano-Catholic acculturation? If so, the kind of acculturation that these deponents conveyed is largely quotidian, and we must often read between the lines to hypothesize it. By the same token, the cultural learning that the informants described was largely devoid of textual mediation, introspection, and intellectual sophistication.

As records of judicial interrogations the selected dossiers primarily reveal a clash between these ordinary and rather vague (or vaguely- rendered) instances of acculturation on one hand, and, on the other hand, normative institutional concepts of true and false religious paths, true and false religious and ethnic identities, and pure and impure human motivations. We discover, then, far less about interactive learning and mutual formation across openly practiced, autonomous cultures, than about the heavily-biased ethnographic curiosity and the religious and political imperatives of Hispano-Catholic functionaries. At most, the selected texts shed a flickering light on the social transformation of Jewish-identified individuals within the framework of a stark imbalance of power between themselves and a religious institution that possessed the cultural capital to investigate and (re-)define them as “Jews,” and then convert them into “Catholics.” Given this imbalance, and the opacity of the declarants’ words, the documents may ultimately help us to understand how certain cultural _obstacles_ characteristic to the early modern centuries conditioned—or precluded—Jewish-Christian exchange across a barbed ethno-religious, political, and socio-economic divide. My oral presentation of the dossiers may well focus on distortion, dissimulation, domination and conformity as over-determined outcomes of this highly conditioned phenomenon of mis- or non-communication.

A final note on the selected sources: Though the dates of both texts may be late for an early modern workshop, a review of the documents makes it reasonably clear that no matter what sea-changes were occurring beyond Spain in the 1790s, the dossiers were products of the traditional religious outlook of a medieval institution—an institution still engaged in a broader competition for souls that the Catholic and Protestant churches had been waging since the sixteenth century.
