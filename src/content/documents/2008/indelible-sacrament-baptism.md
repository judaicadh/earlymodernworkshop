  In theory, under almost all circumstances, once a Jew had been baptized, s/he
  became a Christian and any relapse constituted heresy and was liable to severe
  punishment, often by death. However, in the mid-sixteenth century the Papacy
  adopted a far more lenient policy out of considerations of commercial raison
  d' état and invited New Christian merchants to assume Judaism in Ancona with
  assurance of complete freedom from any persecution. At the same time, Venice
  expelled all Marranos from the city and forbade them to return. The papal
  attitude changed with the Counter- Reformation and former New Christians who
  had reverted to Judaism in Ancona were burned at the stake. However, slightly
  later in a step that was followed by the Medici for Pisa-Livorno, the Venetian
  government invited New Christians to settle in Venice freely on the condition
  that they assumed Judaism and resided in the ghetto as Jews and assured them
  that their past conduct would not be investigated. In justification, among
  other arguments the Venetians pointed out that since Popes had once granted
  such permissions, it could not be claimed that they were forbidden by canon
  law. An examination of select passages from the documents preserved regarding
  the issuing of the first charter of the Levantine and Ponentine merchants in
  Venice in 1589, the two opening passages of the second charter in 1598, and a
  consulto of the Venetian consultore in iure Paolo Sarpi will illustrate the
  ideological background and practical manifestations of the new attitude toward
  New Christians assuming Judaism and their resulting legal status, which can be
  seen as one of the harbingers of a new attitude of European states toward Jews
  determined by economic considerations of raison d’état rather than by
  religious concerns.

## Introduction

**Introduction to Paolo Sarpi's Opinion in the Case against Simon Gomez**

In the following _consulto_ of 1616, the great Venetian _consultore in iure_, Fra Paolo Sarpi, who defended the Venetian government against attacks from the Papacy and on another occasion argued that “the Marranos cannot be subjected to the office of the inquisition, having received a safe conduct enabling them to come and live with their families in the Dominion and leave at their pleasure, with their possessions living in the ghetto and wearing the yellow hat, and to exercise their rites and ceremonies without hindrance and this permission was granted to them for the public benefit of Christianity, so that they should not carry so much wealth and needed industriousness to the lands of the Turks” explains why for various different reasons the Venetian government could not move against a New Christian who had reverted with his two minor children to Judaism in Venice.

Most Serene Doge, the denunciation given to the office of the Inquisition of the city of Pisa by Carl di Romulo against Simon Gomez, Portuguese Jew, presently living in the ghetto of this city and sent to this office of the Inquisition \[in Venice\] and presented by the illustrious Assistenti to Your Serenity \[the Doge\] and seen by us by his commandment, in substance relates that the denouncer knew in the past the said Simon, that he had been living as a Christian in the city of Pisa, and in it he had two sons who had also been baptized - then, finding himself in Venice around the beginning of last September, the denouncer had seen him wearing a red hat professing to be a Jew and denounced him for the unburdening of his own conscience and for the benefit of the children, urging that the matter be dealt with quickly. Regarding this denunciation, we reverently point out that Pope Julius III in 1552 allowed Portuguese Jews to be able to live in Ancona and other cities of the Papal States with their wives and children and to observe their religion even if in other times they had lived as Christians, prohibiting the Inquisitors to proceed against them. And on 27 July 1589 the Most Serene Republic allowed the same people to reside with their families in the ghetto of this city, and living without scandal, with the security of not being able to be investigated even if under other rulers they had lived in another manner. This concession, having the previous example given by the Apostolic See, cannot be revoked in on any account. Previously, when Pope Clement VIII spoke on this matter in 1602, he was told that he was capable of understanding the good reasons that compelled the observance of the faith given, as also occurred in that pontificate on 15 July 1608. Therefore, it is right that having decided that the Portuguese Jews who come in this city with their wives and families, living in the ghetto, wearing the red hat, and not causing scandal, cannot be investigated concerning their life in other states, both for the keeping of the word given for legitimate reasons as also because contravening privileges once granted not only would be a lack of the faith given, but also would open the door to a result of innumerable troubles and place all that nation into confusion without any benefit resulting. Only one case can occur to be excepted, that is when the husband compels the wife or the father the children to live as Jews against their will, in which case it would be a service to God to give them their freedom, but regarding the two children of Simon Gomez we are not in such a case because the older is only three years old and the younger only one, as appears from the present document, therefore being minors there is no doubt that they can be forced \[by their parents – BR\]. We will not omit to observe to observe that the denouncer who, seeing the Jew in Venice around the beginning of September, considered that he should be denounced, was obliged to come to the office \[of the Inquisition\] of this city which very well knows what should be done in its jurisdiction for the benefit of religion and not go to Pisa to make the denunciation as soon as he arrived, as he did on the following 7 October with such affectation and request of a fast resolution, and that Father Inquisitor should still have had consideration to receive it since it had not been committed in his jurisdiction and was by a denouncer who by not having said anything in Venice which was the place to do so but in Pisa as soon as he returned, showed that he had some bad intention. It is usual that an inquisitor receives a denunciation against an absent person because of a crime committed in his jurisdiction or by a denouncer who could not present himself to the judges of the matter \[in the place where the crime was committed\], but if it would be permitted that he who sees or hated in Venice something that did not please him, disregarding the offices of that city goes out of the state to make a denunciation to an inquisitor, and the office of that city be compelled to proceed, it would be not only to agree to receive laws from others, something most detrimental, but also would open the door to the entry of an infinity of very bad consequences, which can be very well known to the most prudent judgment of Your Most Illustrious Excellency. In conclusion, our respectful conclusion would be that the most Illustrious Assistenti respond that if Simon Gomez, a Portuguese Jew living in the ghetto, has given or will give any scandal or really has committed or will commit any offense in this State, he should be severely castigated by the magistrates, but to investigate against him regarding things that occurred in other states would be to subvert the privileges that for most just and necessary reasons were granted many decades earlier by the Republic as also by other religious rulers to that nation, that cannot be violated without breaking the word, and so we think it of justice, submitting all to the highest wisdom of Your Serenity, GRATIE etc.

\[Your\] most humble and devoted servant, Fra Paolo of Venice

17 December 1616
