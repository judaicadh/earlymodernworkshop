description: >-
  In theory, under almost all circumstances, once a Jew had been baptized, s/he
  became a Christian and any relapse constituted heresy and was liable to severe
  punishment, often by death. However, in the mid-sixteenth century the Papacy
  adopted a far more lenient policy out of considerations of commercial raison
  d' état and invited New Christian merchants to assume Judaism in Ancona with
  assurance of complete freedom from any persecution. At the same time, Venice
  expelled all Marranos from the city and forbade them to return. The papal
  attitude changed with the Counter- Reformation and former New Christians who
  had reverted to Judaism in Ancona were burned at the stake. However, slightly
  later in a step that was followed by the Medici for Pisa-Livorno, the Venetian
  government invited New Christians to settle in Venice freely on the condition
  that they assumed Judaism and resided in the ghetto as Jews and assured them
  that their past conduct would not be investigated. In justification, among
  other arguments the Venetians pointed out that since Popes had once granted
  such permissions, it could not be claimed that they were forbidden by canon
  law. An examination of select passages from the documents preserved regarding
  the issuing of the first charter of the Levantine and Ponentine merchants in
  Venice in 1589, the two opening passages of the second charter in 1598, and a
  consulto of the Venetian consultore in iure Paolo Sarpi will illustrate the
  ideological background and practical manifestations of the new attitude toward
  New Christians assuming Judaism and their resulting legal status, which can be
  seen as one of the harbingers of a new attitude of European states toward Jews
  determined by economic considerations of raison d’état rather than by
  religious concerns.

## Introduction

**Introduction to Paolo Sarpi's Opinion in the Case against Simon Gomez**

In the following _consulto_ of 1616, the great Venetian _consultore in iure_, Fra Paolo Sarpi, who defended the Venetian government against attacks from the Papacy and on another occasion argued that “the Marranos cannot be subjected to the office of the inquisition, having received a safe conduct enabling them to come and live with their families in the Dominion and leave at their pleasure, with their possessions living in the ghetto and wearing the yellow hat, and to exercise their rites and ceremonies without hindrance and this permission was granted to them for the public benefit of Christianity, so that they should not carry so much wealth and needed industriousness to the lands of the Turks” explains why for various different reasons the Venetian government could not move against a New Christian who had reverted with his two minor children to Judaism in Venice.

**Introduction to Expelling Marranos from Venice**

In 1550, the Venetian government decided to reenact its legislation of 1497 expelling “Marranos” from Venice. Any who stayed in the city or later returned to it were subject to confiscation of their property and spending two years rowing in chains at the oars in Venetian ships. Also, any Venetians who had any contact with them were to incur the same punishment. This led some Venetian merchants to complain to the government that they were very disturbed because they did not know which of their trading partners were Marranos. The Venetian government realized that its legislation was too draconic and in its place two less harsh alternative motions were presented in the Senate in its place, with the more lenient one passing on the third ballot.

Most Serene Doge, the denunciation given to the office of the Inquisition of the city of Pisa by Carl di Romulo against Simon Gomez, Portuguese Jew, presently living in the ghetto of this city and sent to this office of the Inquisition \[in Venice\] and presented by the illustrious Assistenti to Your Serenity \[the Doge\] and seen by us by his commandment, in substance relates that the denouncer knew in the past the said Simon, that he had been living as a Christian in the city of Pisa, and in it he had two sons who had also been baptized - then, finding himself in Venice around the beginning of last September, the denouncer had seen him wearing a red hat professing to be a Jew and denounced him for the unburdening of his own conscience and for the benefit of the children, urging that the matter be dealt with quickly. Regarding this denunciation, we reverently point out that Pope Julius III in 1552 allowed Portuguese Jews to be able to live in Ancona and other cities of the Papal States with their wives and children and to observe their religion even if in other times they had lived as Christians, prohibiting the Inquisitors to proceed against them. And on 27 July 1589 the Most Serene Republic allowed the same people to reside with their families in the ghetto of this city, and living without scandal, with the security of not being able to be investigated even if under other rulers they had lived in another manner. This concession, having the previous example given by the Apostolic See, cannot be revoked in on any account. Previously, when Pope Clement VIII spoke on this matter in 1602, he was told that he was capable of understanding the good reasons that compelled the observance of the faith given, as also occurred in that pontificate on 15 July 1608. Therefore, it is right that having decided that the Portuguese Jews who come in this city with their wives and families, living in the ghetto, wearing the red hat, and not causing scandal, cannot be investigated concerning their life in other states, both for the keeping of the word given for legitimate reasons as also because contravening privileges once granted not only would be a lack of the faith given, but also would open the door to a result of innumerable troubles and place all that nation into confusion without any benefit resulting. Only one case can occur to be excepted, that is when the husband compels the wife or the father the children to live as Jews against their will, in which case it would be a service to God to give them their freedom, but regarding the two children of Simon Gomez we are not in such a case because the older is only three years old and the younger only one, as appears from the present document, therefore being minors there is no doubt that they can be forced \[by their parents – BR\]. We will not omit to observe to observe that the denouncer who, seeing the Jew in Venice around the beginning of September, considered that he should be denounced, was obliged to come to the office \[of the Inquisition\] of this city which very well knows what should be done in its jurisdiction for the benefit of religion and not go to Pisa to make the denunciation as soon as he arrived, as he did on the following 7 October with such affectation and request of a fast resolution, and that Father Inquisitor should still have had consideration to receive it since it had not been committed in his jurisdiction and was by a denouncer who by not having said anything in Venice which was the place to do so but in Pisa as soon as he returned, showed that he had some bad intention. It is usual that an inquisitor receives a denunciation against an absent person because of a crime committed in his jurisdiction or by a denouncer who could not present himself to the judges of the matter \[in the place where the crime was committed\], but if it would be permitted that he who sees or hated in Venice something that did not please him, disregarding the offices of that city goes out of the state to make a denunciation to an inquisitor, and the office of that city be compelled to proceed, it would be not only to agree to receive laws from others, something most detrimental, but also would open the door to the entry of an infinity of very bad consequences, which can be very well known to the most prudent judgment of Your Most Illustrious Excellency. In conclusion, our respectful conclusion would be that the most Illustrious Assistenti respond that if Simon Gomez, a Portuguese Jew living in the ghetto, has given or will give any scandal or really has committed or will commit any offense in this State, he should be severely castigated by the magistrates, but to investigate against him regarding things that occurred in other states would be to subvert the privileges that for most just and necessary reasons were granted many decades earlier by the Republic as also by other religious rulers to that nation, that cannot be violated without breaking the word, and so we think it of justice, submitting all to the highest wisdom of Your Serenity, GRATIE etc.

\[Your\] most humble and devoted servant, Fra Paolo of Venice

These documents have been published in Kaufmann, “Die Vetreibung der Marranen aus Venedig im Jahre 1550,” _Jewish Quarterly Review_, o.s., 13 (1900 1901): 525-530, partial English translation in Chambers and Pullan, _Venice: A Documentary History_, pp. 345-346.

A  
Senate legislation of 8 July1550

Although on November 13, 1497 this Christian council wisely legislated that the Marranos, faithless people without religion and so hostile to God, be banished from our state and all association and contact with our subjects was taken away from them under grave penalties as contained in that law which is now read, nevertheless, it seems that notwithstanding that legislation, the number of these Marranos has increased both in this city and in our towns and places, so that it is necessary for the honor of the Divine Majesty and also for the benefit of our affairs to renew so useful and holy a provision in order that this infectious kind of people be kept away from our state. Therefore, confirming completely the said law of 1497, which is to be observed and carried out, it is to be proclaimed publicly in this city and outside it in each of our towns and places on land and sea that these Marranos are to depart from our state within two months without any excuse, under pain of confiscation of all their property and serving two years at the oars in chains. They may not return here in any way at any time, subject to the same penalty. Any noble, citizen or citizen or subject of ours who after that time will be found to have had or to have any business, relations or intelligence with any of the above-mentioned Marranos will immediately incur the same penalty, which is immediately to be carried out irremissibly, without any pardon, remission or compensation. And the implementation of the present legislation is to be entrusted to the magistracy of our Censors (except however always for the authority and prerogative of our Avogadori di Comun), who under oath and subject to penalty of five hundred ducats each irremissibly \[...\] And the same benefit is to be given to those who denounce to the Rectors outside our city those Marranos who, after the two months have expired, dare secretly or openly to dwell in our state or those who have any contact with them. This law is to be promulgated on the steps of San Marco and Rialto and sent to each of our Rectors on land and at sea, and even included in their commission and it cannot be suspended, revoked or altered or in any way interpreted, except by a motion introduced in this Council by all the ministers of our College with all in attendance and passed by a five-sixth majority with at least one hundred and fifty in attendance.

Senate legislation of 22 August 1550

_Under Venetian parliamentary procedure, for a motion to pass, the number of positive votes had to exceed the combined total of the negative votes and abstentions, and similarly for it to be rejected, the total of negative votes had to exceed the combined total of of positive votes and abstentions. In other words, a clear majority of positive or negatives votes was required, and if none resulted on the first ballot, the motion was voted upon again. If after a few more ballots no majority resulted, then the motion was left pending. Also, it was possible for a second or third "countermotion" to be simultaneously introduced, and for either to pass, a clear majority of positive votes was needed; otherwise, additional rounds of balloting would take place. In the following case, on the first ballot, the main motion received 79 positive votes, 11 negative votes and 14 abstentions, while the second received 97 positive votes; thus neither obtained the majority needed. The second ballot was no more decisive, 81-xx- 17-99. Thereupon, only the second motion, which had received more positive votes, was introduced, and it passed easily, 132-27-19_.

It was resolved in this Council on the eighth of the past month that the Marranos are to leave our state by the end of two months and never return here again, under pain of confiscation of all their property and serving two years in the galleys, and those nobles, citizens or subject of ours who after that time are found to have business, contact or intelligence with any of those Marranos are to be subject to the same punishment. Because of this, many citizens and merchants of the circle of the Rialto of all nations came to us and related that they find themselves in great confusion because of that law, as is learned from the document now read, not knowing who are or are not Marranos, and also fearing that all Marranos with whom they trade, even if they live in foreign countries, are included in this law, and because of this, very great confusion resulted, and therefore they have requested a suitable remedy. Thus, so that one can determine the truth of what is above stated and so that one can carry out the above law of July 8 in such a manner that the merchants are free of the fear in which they find themselves and know how to conduct themselves in trading,

Let our Censors be required, within the period of six months, which cannot be extended for any reason, to act so that they, together with the ordinary Investigators of Heresy, make a diligent investigation of those who are called Marranos, and if they are judged to be Marranos, then carry out whatever implementation shall appear appropriate against them, but the contracts they made up to now with our citizens and merchants are to be valid and binding. As far as the merchants and other subjects of ours who trade with those who are called Marranos who do not live in this city or in the lands of our state, since one cannot know whether they are judged to be Marranos or not, and since one had in mind only those who lived in our city and state, therefore, let it be resolved that they are not to be subject to the above legislation as is appropriate. But if they want to do business with those Marranos or other foreigners, they are obliged to pay all the duties and taxes that foreigners pay and that those would pay were they in this city, subject to all the penalties in our laws.

In favor 79 81 Against 11 -- Abstain 14 17

From the memorandum of the merchants of the circle of the Rialto which has now been read, this Council has heard that which they have set forth and request. And since it is proper to free those merchants from the fear in which they say they find themselves so that they can continue freely in their trade, by authority of this Council let it be declared that our said merchants, nobles, citizens and subjects are not to be liable to any penalty for the contracts made up to now and those they will make in the future with the Marranos who are presently found in this city, as also with others living outside our state, but they may negotiate, do business and correspond with them and send each other their goods and merchandise freely and securely, no more and no less than they could do before the above law of the eighth of the past month, since it was not the intention of that law to prohibit our subjects to trade with the Marranos who are and will be in other lands and states, but only to prohibit those Marranos from coming to live and lurk/settle/anidarsi in this city and state in accordance with the holy laws of our most wise and religious forefathers.

Serenissimo prencipe. La denoncia data nell’officio dell’Inquisitione della città di Pisa da Carlo di Romulo contra Simon Gomez hebreo portughese habitante al presente nel ghetto di questa città, mandata a quest’officio dell’Inquisitione et dalli illustrissimi signori assistenti presentata all Serenità Vostra et da noi veduta per suo commandamento, in sostanza contiene che il denonciante ha consociuto per i tempi passati il detto Simone, che è vissuto da christiano nella città di Pisa et in quella ha havuto due figliuole che sono anco stato battezzate, poi, ritrovandosi in Venezia circa il principio di Settembre prossimo passsato, l’ha veduto con capel rosso facendo professione di hebreo, il che denoncia per scarico della conscientia sua et per beneficio delle figliuole, essortando ad accellerare la provisione. Sopra la qual denoncia diremo riverentemente che la papa Giulio terzo del 1552 concesse alli Hebrei portughesi di poter habitar in Ancona et altre terre dello stato ecclesiastico essi con le loro mogli et figliuoli et osservar la loro religione ancora che in altri tempi havessero vissuto christianamente, prohibendo alli inqusitori di proceder contro di loro. Et dalla serenissima Republica del 1589, 27 luglio, fu concesso alli medesmi di habitare con le proprie famiglie nel ghetto di questa città vivendo senza scandolo con sicurezza di non poter esser ricercati, quantonque sotto altri principi havessero vissuto in altra maniera, la qual concessione, havendo l’essempio precedente dato dalla Sede Apostolica, non può esser ripresa in alcun conto, anzi che havendo parlato papa Clemente ottavo di questa materia in 1602, fu per deliberazione dell’eccellentissimo Senato delli 12 ottobre risposto a qual pontefice et reso capace delle buone ragioni che constringono ad osservar la fede data, il che ancora occorse in questo pontificato del 1608, 18 giugno. Per il che conviene haver per deciso che contra li Hebrei portughesi che vengono in questa città con le loro mogli et figli è giusta cosa che, vivendo in ghetto et portando il capello rosso, ne dando scandolo, non possi esser inquisito sopra la vita tenuta da loro in altri dominii così per mantenimento della parola data per cause legitime come anco perché, contravenendo alli privilegii una volta concessi, non solo sarebbe un mancar della fede data, ma un aprir porta ad una consequenza d’inconvenienti innumerabili et metter confusione in tutta quella natione senza però che che ne seguise alcun bene. Un solo caso potrebbe occorrer da esser eccettuato, cioé quando il marito costringesse la moglie over il padre li figlioli a viver nell’Hebraismo contra la loro volontà, nel quale sarebbe servitio di Dio renderli la loro libertà, ma per conto delle due figlie di Simon Gomez non siamo in questo caso poiché la maggiore ha finito solo 3 anni et la minore solo un anno, come per le fede presente appare, laonde essendo in età infantile non si può far dubio che possino esser sforzate. Non resteremo di aggionger riverentemente che il denonciante, qual vidde l’hebreo in Venetia circa il principio di settembre, se reputava che dovesse esser denonciato, era tenuto comparir all’officio di questa città, che molto ben sa quello che per servitio della religione si debba fare nella giurisdittione sua et non andar a Pisa a far la denoncia apena gionto, come fece a 7 ottobre seguente con tanta affettatione et instanza dipresta provisione et quel padre inquisitor doveva ancor haver risguardo a riceverla sopra cosa non commessa sotto la giurisdittione sua et da un denonciante, che dal non haver detto cosa alcuna in Venetia dove era il luoco di farlo, ma in Pisa, apena ritornato, mostra che havesse qualche cattiva intentione. Si costuma che un inquisitor receva denoncia contra persona assente per delitto commesso nella sua giurisdittione overo da denonciante che non possa presentarsi al giudice del reo, ma quando fosse permesso che chi vede overo ode in Venetia cosa che non li piace potesse, tralasciato l’officii di questa città, andar fuori dello Stato da un inquisitore a farne denoncia et sopra quella l’officio di questa città fosse constretto proceder, sarebbe non solo consentir che ricevesse leggi da gl’altri, cosa preiudicialissima, ma anco sarebbe aprir una porta all’ingresso d’infinità di pessime consequenze, le quali possono esser molto più conosciute dal prudentissimo giudicio di vostre eccellenze illustrissime. Per conclusione il nostro riverente parer sarebbe che dalli illustrissimi signori assistenti fosse risposto che se Simon Gomez, hebreo portughese habitante nel ghetto, haverà dato o darà scandolo alcuno o veramente haverà commesso o commetterà qualche fallo in questa Dominio, sarà alla magistrati castigato severamente, ma l’inquisir contra lui delle cose avvenute negl’altri dominii sarebbe un sovvertir li privilegii che per giustissime et necessarie cause sono concessi già molte decenne d’anni dalla Repubblica come anco altrove da altri prencipi religiosi a quella natione, li quali non si possono violare senza mancar della parola et tanto noi stimiamo che sia di giustitia, sottomettendo il tutto alla somma sapienza di Vostra Serenità. Gratie et cetera.

Humilissimo et devotissimo servitor fra’ Paulo di Venetia.
