description: >-
  In theory, under almost all circumstances, once a Jew had been baptized, s/he
  became a Christian and any relapse constituted heresy and was liable to severe
  punishment, often by death. However, in the mid-sixteenth century the Papacy
  adopted a far more lenient policy out of considerations of commercial raison
  d' état and invited New Christian merchants to assume Judaism in Ancona with
  assurance of complete freedom from any persecution. At the same time, Venice
  expelled all Marranos from the city and forbade them to return. The papal
  attitude changed with the Counter- Reformation and former New Christians who
  had reverted to Judaism in Ancona were burned at the stake. However, slightly
  later in a step that was followed by the Medici for Pisa-Livorno, the Venetian
  government invited New Christians to settle in Venice freely on the condition
  that they assumed Judaism and resided in the ghetto as Jews and assured them
  that their past conduct would not be investigated. In justification, among
  other arguments the Venetians pointed out that since Popes had once granted
  such permissions, it could not be claimed that they were forbidden by canon
  law. An examination of select passages from the documents preserved regarding
  the issuing of the first charter of the Levantine and Ponentine merchants in
  Venice in 1589, the two opening passages of the second charter in 1598, and a
  consulto of the Venetian consultore in iure Paolo Sarpi will illustrate the
  ideological background and practical manifestations of the new attitude toward
  New Christians assuming Judaism and their resulting legal status, which can be
  seen as one of the harbingers of a new attitude of European states toward Jews
  determined by economic considerations of raison d’état rather than by
  religious concerns.
