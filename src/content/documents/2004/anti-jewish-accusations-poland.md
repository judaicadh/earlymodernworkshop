description: Anti-Jewish accusations of host desecration and ritual murder, both
  of medieval origin and nature, became characteristic of the early modern
  period in Poland. Despite their medieval roots, some of the medieval
  characteristics of the accusations were gradually lost in the early modern
  period, even though their traces continue to appear in the sources. The
  presentation discusses the loss of theological significance of the
  accusations. The host desecration accusations gradually become church robbery
  cases, even if some theological rhetoric is retained, and the blood libels
  become cases of Jewish hostility and not of reenacting of the Crucifixion.

Introduction to a Decree Concerning Church Robbery

The text presented here is a decree of a Lithuanian Tribunal against Jews involved in a church robbery in a small Lithuanian town in 1700. As with most court records preserved in Poland this document is a summary of the trial, it is repetitious, repeating testimonies, each time it refers to a previous court action. Some of these verbatim repetitions have been shortened here. For Polish court records, it is extremely rare to have full records of interrogations similar to those found in Inquisition records in Italy, or Spain. Most of the time, it is a final narrative, composed by the court scribe for permanent record, the so called “clean copy.” The “clean copy” is based on notes compiled during the whole trial known as _brudnopis_, literally “a smudged/dirty copy.” The _brudnopis_ was customarily destroyed after the “clean copy” was filed. As a result we are left with a scribal narrative, with actual testimonies omitted, roughly summarized, or with some verbatim fragments sometimes included at the scribe's discretion.

The text presented here shows a narrative that can be seen as a transitional narrative from the medieval, although characteristic of the early modern period in Poland, host desecration accusations that include miracles caused by the abuse of the host to narratives of church robbery, a criminal offence. Toward the end of the early modern period era, theological significance of the accusations is gradually lost even in Poland, although, as in this document, the traces of theological anti-Jewish rhetoric continue to appear in sources. A similar transition process occurs with ritual murder accusations, which are gradually transformed into narratives of cruel murder cases, devoid of their religious significance.

For more information about the accusations of host desecration against Jews see, the introduction to chapter VIII: “O Świętokradzwach Nayświętszego Sakramentu” \[On the Desecrations of the Most Holy Sacrament\] from Stefan Żuchowski's book _Process Kryminalny o niewinne dziecię Jana Krosnowskiego_ \[A criminal trial concerning the innocent child Jan Krosnowski\] (Sandomierz 1713?).

A Decree by the Tribunal of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Concerning a Church Robbery

Akty izdavaemye vilenskoiu kommisieiu dla razbora drevnikh aktov Court Records, 1700

Year 1700, in the month of June, on the 19th day

Before us, the principal judges of the Great Duchy of Lithuania, has come a case concerning an accusation \[filed\] by God's Reverend, priest Dawid Podebronowicz of the Komayski parish Church, and by its sacristan, Krzysztof Łukaszewicz, against the infidel Jew, Jakub Salamonowicz, from the city of Pinczów, the leader \[of the gang\]; Nochim of Lublin, Israel of Przeworsk, Yohel of Murawa near Nikliszporek--sacrilegious thieves wandering from town to town in order to steal, and against Moszko alias Moyżesz, also known as Senator, who lives in the town of Wiżuny, who is their leader as well; and against his helpers: Kasrel Moyżeszowicz, Jakub Izakowicz, Abram Salmonowicz, and all \[leaders of\] Jewish kahal of Wiżuny and Kowary, who are now in Wilno \[visiting\] lord Jan of Goryszewo Goryszewski, esquire \[_stolnik_\], the under-_starosta_ of Wilkomierz, and the lease-holder \[_arendarz_\] of Wiżuny to take counsel about this robbery.

\[The plaintiffs claim\] in a decree presented to the accused persons that: on the 26th of April of the current year 1700 the above mentioned Jews, Jakub Salomonowicz, Nochim of Lublin, Izrael of Przeorsk, Johel of Moraw, who were wandering and stealing in the various royal towns, especially in the city of Wilno, and causing a lot of damage to people, just before the commencement of the Tribunal had begun its proceedings, and knowing well about the generous donation of the miraculous painting of the Most Holy Virgin in the Komayski church, decorated in gold, silver, pearls and other gems, awoke a appetite for the\[se gems\], and somehow in their thievish manner broke into the Komayski church through a strong door; and having broken the ciborium with axes, dared to take with their foul hands the _sacra sacrorum_, a box with forty communion wafers for the Jews in other kahals, offending the Lord's Sublimity. At the same time they stole two empty chalices, and having stripped the altar of St. John, and the painting of the Most Holy Virgin, off its pearls, golden rings, silver and other splendors that were on this painting, and two silver hanging candelabra, they took them with their sacrilegious hands. And not being satisfied with this, they also broke into the sacristy in a thievish way, and stole a large silver monstrance and the parish priest's money, and many other things, which according to the registry of items, are easily worth twelve thousand zloty. And so, they, in their adamant malice, stripped the Komayski church, and \[thereby\] God's glory, off their silver and splendor. And they took it all to the accused Moszko, who lives in Wiżuny, and at his place they divided the spoils and the money; and so, when the parish priest noticed this godless robbery of the Komayski church, he notified lord _starosta_ Rumborski, who is the church's patron, and with his people began to inquire about the robbery, requesting that should anyone see the stolen items or anyone selling them, he should inform \[the starosta\]; several days after this inquiry ... having searched for the sacrilegious thieves of the above mentioned items--clothes, golden crowns, and silver candelabra, Lord Stanisław Giedroyć and Lord Stanisław Moygis, in the absence of the parish priest, caught the now-accused Jew Jakub Salomonowicz and other impious Jews in his company, and some Jewish women, as they were hiding in the field two miles from Kowersk, and brought these accused thieves, Jakub Salomonowicz and Iohyl of Murawa, with two Jewish women, to Kowarsk, where the Jews of Kowarsk, with all their kahal, apparently empathized with the robbery, and, therefore, became participants and accomplices, \[for \] they organized a tumult, on April 29th of the above mentioned year, and disregarding the severity of the common law designed against such dissolute people, they retook these Jewish thieves, the Jew of Murawa and the two Jewish women, whom they now hide among themselves. These were the Jews that Lord Giedroyć and Lord Moygis had arrested and for whom they had received guarantees from the kahal, but despite these guarantees, no one knows where these Jewish men and women are.

And Jakub Salamonowicz \[sic\] after having been left alone, and \[apparently\] desiring to avoid serious punishment, which he deserved because of his crimes, took an iron candlestick and attempted to hurt himself in his throat and side, almost killing himself. And, therefore, the parish priest of the Komayski church, who had brought the case forth, who had accepted the report of the lords, and especially the testimony of the accused, Jakub Salomonowicz, that the stolen silver and the church's ornaments can be found in the house of the accused Jew, Moszko alias Mojżesz Senator, who lives in Wiżuny, where they all lived before and after the robbery, beseeched the lord Goryszewski, the court official, _podstarosta_ Wilkomirski, at the time the lease-holder of the estate of Wiżuny, to seek justice against this Jew Moszko, and to release him to court. And \[the priest\] sought help from lord Raiecki, the _starosta_ of Rumborsk and a collator of the Komayski church in order to demand of lord Goryszewski and his wife, who are dissidents in religion and, therefore, enemies of the Roman Catholic Church, to release the accused Jew at once. Not only did Lord Goryszewski not bring the Jews to justice but also accepted them in his manor and guaranteed the safety to those accused Jews, Kastel Moyżeszowicz, Jakub Izakowicz, Abram Salamonowicz, living in Wiżuny, and this Jew, Moszko, their leader and sacrilegious thief, and evident bandit, and treated them lightly, despite the pleading of the Komayski parish priest. And so, when the plaintiff \[the parish priest\], desiring to take the case to the court of the main tribunal, and having entrusted the criminal to the tribunal guards, in a friendly manner requested that the Jew secured by lord Goryszewski be brought in, not only did \[lord Goryszewski\], clearly in violation of the rules of the tribunal, not bring the Jew, Moszko, but also, here in the city of Wilno, on June 5 of the current year, gravely threatened the life of the priest, who is the plaintiff, and who now \[accuses\] lord Goryszewski of failing to bring the accused Jews to justice for \[the crimes of Jews repeated here\]... by hiding the Jewish vagrants, thieves, and bandits and providing them with advice and support, and also \[accused him\] of treating these Jews \[here names of all of them again\] lightly, and of willingly releasing the Jews that had been caught and demanded before the court \[do wskazania paenas criminalissimas-untranslatable\] to return or to reimburse for the golden, silver items and other decorative things stolen from the Komayski church and for the expenses, which the priest has had and still has....

And, after repeated postponements of this case on June 9, 12, and 16th on which the accused infidel Jew, Jakub Salomonowicz was brought in person from his arrest to stand in court in person, on June 19 of this year, the representatives of the infidel Jew, Jakub Salmonowicz, lord Jerzy Woytkiewicz and Paweł Rewienski, having seen copies of these proceedings, and Jan Suroż Frąckiewicz and lord Michał Bohdanowicz, in presence of the priest of the Komayski Church, having been summoned by court officials \[finally\] appeared in court and the court proceeded with the trial. Therefore, representing the plaintiff, Lord Frąckowicz, stated his case against Jews, Jakub Salomonowicz, present here under arrest, Moyżesz-Senator, Kaszrel Moyżeszowicz, Jakub Izakowicz and Abram Salamonowicz, and against the whole Jewish kahals of Wiżuny and Kowary, and the local \[kahal\] here in the royal city of Wilno beyond the Gate of Troki, also against Nachim of Lublin, Izrael of Przeorsk, Iohil of Murawa, and lord

Goryszewski...that at night of 25th onto 26th of April of the current year, these accused Jews broke into the Komayski church and having crashed the ciborium \[pyx\] with an ax they took the box with 40 pieces of the Host \[kommunikanty\], and gave it to other Jews and kahals or perhaps hid it somewhere, and they took two empty goblets, and a picture of the Most Holy Virgin and they stripped the altar of St. John off all ornaments, silver and gems, and they took two silver hanging lamps, and having broken into sacristy, they took a large silver monstrance and the plaintiff's money, all worth about twelve thousand zloty. And they took all the silver to Moszko, the Jew of Wiżuń, and they probably split the silver and money among themselves; and then, when they were fleeing Wiżuny, after the capture of the above mentioned Jakub Salomonowicz and Iochil of Morawy, his companion with two Jewish women, who were brought to Kowarsk by Lord Gieydoryć and Lord Moygis on April 29 that year, the Jews of Kowarsk having organized a tumult, recaptured the Jew of Morawy and the two Jewish women. But, having received the information that the Jew of Wiżuny illegally held the silver stolen from the church, Lord Goryszewski was asked to bring him to the office just as any criminal would have to be \[brought\]; but the kahal of Wiżuny offered a bail for him, and because Lord Goryszewski is a dissident in religion, he released this criminal to their hands without doing justice, and causing delays in court procedures. Moreover, committing all kind of excesses in our courts, \[the Jews of Wiżuny and Lord Goryszewski\] threatened the well-being of the plaintiffs, which is showed in the excerpts \[of testimonies?\] given on June 5th of that year, in the report of the generals, and in the registry of the losses filed in the Wilno magistrate.

And the plaintiff requested that the arrested Jew, Jakub Salamonowicz, be sent to torture so that one can extract more information, but Lord Rawienski, a patron of this Jew Salomonowicz, protested and stated that his client is not guilty, not even a suspect, because he did not commit any theft and \[he said\] that the plaintiff had not proven anything, because nothing was found with him, and he only met the other Jews and they continued along, and when they were captured they took only him to Kowarsk, and the others fled, which perhaps means that they were guilty. But he is innocent, and that's why he did not flee. And so, citing article 61 in chapter eleven of the common law statutes, asked that the case be referred for further inquiry. To this protest by Lord Rawienski, Lord Bohdanowicz responded that it was unnecessary to send this case for further inquiry because everyone in the Wilkomierski district knows that the Komayski church was robbed by the Jews. And the items displayed in this court had been found with the accused Jews, in whose company this Jew found himself; and therefore considering the deposition by the Jew during the first round of corporal inquiries, he requested that the Jew be punished; and if necessary the sacristan of the Komayski church should take an oath.

And Lord Woytkiewicz, representing Jakub Salamonowicz, was arguing that Jakub Salamonowicz was closer to being acquitted because he was innocent, not a suspect and was captured without any stolen items, and in order to prove his innocence even better, he requested that the plaintiffs, if they claim that he is guilty, testify according to the law in the inquisition/inquiry and that this whole case be referred to a higher court \[locum loci\]. And in this case we \[court\] require, for the moment, no oath from the parish priest of the Komayski church, and the sacristan, and send Jakub Salamonowicz, who had been captured with stolen items, for corporal inquiry under torture, which is to take place on June 21 in the usual place, and thus we set the date for the final hearing for June 23.

And after the corporal inquiry of the accused Jew, Jakub Salamonowicz, when this case returned to court on June 26, the representative of the plaintiff priest of the Komayski church, lord Frąckiewicz, demanded that the Jew, Jakub Salamonowicz be brought personally to the court, and others agreed. And lord Frąckiewicz, the representative of the plaintiff read the results of the inquiry of the Jew, Jakub Salamonowicz, that took place as it was decreed by our court, on June 19th, it was signed by the generals and which follows verbatim \[de verbo ad verbum\]: The confession of the Jew, Jakub Salamonowicz, made in on June 21, 1700 here in Wilno, in accordance with a decree of the main tribunal.

First before the inquiry, this Jew, Jakub Salamonowicz, did not admit that he was in Komaie, robbing the church with those other Jews, that is with Izrael of Przeorsk, Nochim of Lublin, Ichil of Nikliszporek, but that he only heard on the side that the above mentioned Jews, Izrael Nochim and Ichel, having celebrated Shabbat \[odprawiwszy szabas\], left Wiżuny and went to EMW 2004

Komaie, and having returned from there with silver, sold it to the Jew, Moszko, a.k.a Moyżesz, known as Senator, for ninety thalers, and they picked up the money and only forty five zloty was left with Moszko in Wiżuny. But after the first pull, Jakub Salamonowicz confessed that the Jew, Meier, an arrendator of Onikszty, had persuaded the other three Jews to rob the Komayski church, and when he was further queried he confessed that he had also been in their company, when they opened the church at night not with fire but with a tool \[witrych\], he stood as a watch guard at the cemetery, while the other three broke the ciborium with axes and stole the box with holy Hosts, two goblets and two silver plates from sacristy, a monstrance, two lamps and sold all this silver to the Jew, Moszko Senator, in Wiżuny, and they gave to Moszko the box with hosts, which he said looked like nickels. And \[Moszko\] then took them out with his lewd hands, and having put them on paper, he gave them to his wife to hide, and they conspired to burn the \[hosts\]. During the second \[pulling\] he confessed that the rest of the silver they had taken to Meier, the Jew of Oniksztan and a relative of Moszko's, but \[Meier\] did not want to take it because \[he was upset\] that they had not come to him first, and that's why the other three Jews had the silver items, with which they were recaptured in Kowarsk. And during the third \[pulling\] this Jew, the thief, confessed that during the fair of St. George in Wiżuny, Ayzik, the Woynoyski arrendator, and a son of Gerson the arrendator of Lord Sokołowski, conspired with Moszko Senator and his three companions to steal this silver, and they were supposed to divide the loot up but then they did not give him anything; and Ayzik ordered the thieves not to tell anyone where they go, and only to tell that we were going to Rakiszki, and in the tavern where Ayzik's wife \[worked?\] they drank vodka and beer and they inadvertently went to Komay, and hid in the fields till the evening. And he did not confess to any other theft. Piotr Adamowicz, the general of His Majesty the King who was present during the interrogation \[_confessata_\], signed with his own hand.

And after reading this \[report of\] interrogation, the complaint by the plaintiffs and the registry \[of lost items\], ... \[we see\] seeing proofs, which have come form the interrogation, that Jews had broken into the Komayski church without violence, opened the lock with a tool \[_wytrych_\], and broke the ciborium with an ax, and \[then\] stole the box with hosts, and two goblets, and two silver trays, a monstrance, and two lamps; and they took all this silver to Moszko, the Jew of Wizuny, who dared to put the hosts onto his sacrilegious hands \[ad manus sacrileges\] and in offense to the Christian faith hid them. And it has been evidently shown that these numerous sacrilegious Jews of Kowarsk knew whom to recapture, and the kahal of Wiżuny also knew whom to bail out, and Lord Goryszewski did not want to release Moszko, the Jew and leader and a notorious thief, whom he also bailed out. And it has been shown that this Jew, Jakub Salamonowicz was in their company, and participated in this robbery, and that this was a collaborative robbery; that's also according to further testimony by the Komayski church sacristan, Krzysztof Łukaszewski, that on April 25 of the current year the accused Jews now bailed out by Lord Goryszewski, the Brest official and other people, had broken into the church, then broke the ciborium with axes, took a tin with forty six Hosts, two empty goblets, which they may have taken to kahals, and they stripped paintings of their ornaments and gems,took two hanging lamps, and a large monstrance from the sacristy, all worth twelve thousand \[zloty?\]; and after the \[thieves\] had been caught and brought into Kowarsk, the Jews of Kowarsk recaptured them on the 29th of April, having created a tumult, thus the Jew of Morawy and two Jewish women were recaptured.

Therefore, since this Jew Moszko of Wiżuny bought the church silver from these thieves for ninety thalers, and hid these evildoers in his house, after the Wiżuny kahal had pledged for them, and still did not bring them to court after our judgement over Jakub Salamonowicz, \[the general and representative of the priest demanded that Moszko and\] also Nochim, Izrael, and Ichil and Moszko the Senator, and those Jews of the Kowarsk kahal, who had known about all this, and some Jews of the Wiżuny kahal , who had bailed Moszko out but failed to bring him court, be punished by life burning; and because Nochim, Izrael, Ichil, Moszko and those who had bailed them out: Kaszrel Moyżeszowicz, Jakub Izakowicz, Abram Salamonowicz and all the Wiżuny kahal, and elders of the Kowarsk kahal, as well as Lord Goryszewski with his wife failed to show up in court, \[the general demanded that\] they all be sentenced to infamy and that an order of arrest be issued. Moreover, in order to compensate for the loss of silver--worth at least twelve thousand or in generous estimate twenty four thousand that the church had suffered-- and also for the court expenses--all worth about six hundred Polish zloty should be paid from their estates, businesses, merchandise, arendas and other assets to the parish priest of the Komayski church....

The patron of Jakub Salamonowicz, Lord Rewienski responded that his client, that is Jakub Slamonowicz, was innocent, because Izrael , Nochim and Ichel forced Jakub to participate when they went to rob the church, and they put him on guard while they were stripping the church off the ornaments, and he did so unwillingly, and they even did not give him any of the silver they had stolen, but gave everything to Moszko the Senator, and he was captured without any stolen item on the way to Kowarsk.... And \[Jakub Salamonowicz\] did not touch the silver, or the money, and nothing was found on him, and he \[emphasized that Jakub\] was not guilty of anything that the priest of the Komayski church had brought forth, and he demanded that his client be freed upon an oath.

Lord Bohdanowicz, the representative of the priest, responded that Jakub Salamowicz has no excuse, saying that the other Jews forced him into this, because no one can be forced to do things like that, and moreover, after the third pull during the interrogation he confessed that Ayzik, the son of Gershon the arrendator of Lord Sokołowski, and Moszko Senator persuaded him to commit this sacrilegious act, having informed him about everything during the fair of St. George, and, therefore, he had known well why they had gone to Komaye, and, therefore, he could not have been forced to do it, and, therefore, \[lord Bohdanowicz\] demanded that the Jew be sentenced to death by live-burning....

And finally, Lord Woytkiewicz broadly speaking, stated that this Jew confessed under torture in terrible pain not knowing what he was saying, and only now he is confessing what reallyhappened and \[lord Woytkiewicz\] demanded that \[Jakub\] be asked to take an oath and after

that be freed. And so we in this case between Dawid Podebrynowicz, reverend priest of the Komayski church, in representation by Jan Krzysztof Łukaszewicz, the sacristan of the said church and the unfaithful Jew, Jakub Salamonowicz, of the town of Pinczów, and Nochim of Lublin, Izrael of Przeworsk, Ichil of Morawy, Moszko Moyżesz, known as Senator, Kaszrel Moyżeszowicz, Jakub Izakowicz, Abram Slamonowicz, and all Jewish kahal of Wiżuny and the elders of Kowarsk and also Lord Jan of Goryszew Goryszewski...based on the evidence submitted by reverend parish priest of Komayski church and also the corporal interrogation of the Jew, Jakub Salamonowicz, who had confessed to have participated in this sacrilegious act of robbery of the Komayski church with other Jews, we the court taking into account the common law and holy justice...sentence the above mentioned Jew, Jakub Salamonowicz to death by burning as a sacrilegious thief, and we order that the execution take place at the usual place at a time to be specified and the remaining accused to pay the losses in the Komayski church caused by Jews, and worth 12 thousand zloty, and generously \[sowito\] estimated for 24 thousand, and the court expenses estimated at 600 zl, all together 24,610 zloty to be paid from the estates and domains, houses, businesses, arenda, moveable and immoveable property wherever they can be extracted. And we sentence the accused Jews themselves, Nochim of Lublin, Izrael of Przeworsk, Ichil of Morawy, Moszko Moyżesz, known as Senator, Kaszrel Moyżeszowicz, Jakub Izakowicz, Abram Slamonowicz, and all Jewish kahal of Wiżuny and the elders of Kowarsk and also Lord Jan of Goryszew Goryszewski and his wife for participating in the plot and not releasing Moszko the perpetrator of sacrilege and the leader of the band to infamy, and we order these now fugitives \[infamisy\] be announced all over and that they should be arrested so that they can be executed.

And ... the oath of the sacristan follows: 'I Krzysztof Łukaszewicz swear in the name of God

Almighty, One in Trinity that on the night of April 25 to 26th 1700 the infidel Jews Jakub Salamonowicz of Pinczów, Nachim of Lublin, Izrael of Przeworsk, Ichil of Morawy near Nikliszporek, Moszko--also known as Moyżesz Senator, who have been bailed out by Lord Goryszewski, an official of Brest \[_stolnik Brzeski_\] and others, broke into the church in Komaye be opening the lock, and having broken the ciborium with an ax, they stole the tin with forty six Hosts, two goblets, which they took either to the kahals or something else, \[and they\] stripped paintings of their ornaments, silver and gems, and they took two hanging lamps and from the sacristy they took a large monstrance and money, all this worth twelve thousand złoty. And when they were captured in a chase and brought to Kowarsk the Jews of Kowarsk recaptured the Jew of Morawy and two Jewish women on April 29, 1700 having organized a tumult. And I swear, God Help me, that this Jew Moszko of Wiżuny bought the church silver from the thieves for ninety thallers, and hid the evil-doers in his place, whom in the end the kahal of Wiżuny took under their guarantee. And if I testified unjustly, please God destroy me. And after the accepting this oath, the general, Piotr Zynza, who supervised the court, following the common law and the court order, pronounced the infidel Jews: Nochim of Lublin, Izrael of Przeorsk, Ichil of Morawy, Moszko--also known as Moyżesz Senator, Kasrel Moyżeszowicz, JakubIzakowicz, Abram Salamonowicz and all of the Wiżuny kahal and the elders of the kahal in EMW 2004

Kowarsk to be fugitives \[_infamisy_\] deserving death and issued an order of arrest; and he pronounced Lord Jan Goryszewski and his wife as _infamisy_ as well. And therefore, we the court, deem this decree valid.
