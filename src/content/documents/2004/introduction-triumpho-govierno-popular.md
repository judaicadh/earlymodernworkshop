### Introduction to Triumpho del Govierno Popular

Anne Oravetz Albert, University of Pennsylvania, USA

Born a converso in Spain, Daniel Levi (a.k.a. Miguel) de Barrios emigrated to Livorno to convert to Judaism, and after some travels settled in the Sephardic congregation in Amsterdam. He is known to have continued to compose poetry for Catholics with whom he maintained contact in Brussels through the 1660s, and to have been ignited with messianic enthusiasm in the early 1670s. The Triumpho del Govierno Popular, y de la Antiguedad Holandesa describes the political and religious 'government' of the community, and includes accounts of its literary and charitable associations, along with poems, encomia, funeral orations, and other miscellanea from de Barrios' Jewish oeuvre. This excerpt constitutes the opening of the work, part of a 58- page introduction which sets a theme for the rest by relating the exilic governance of the Jewish people to the six days of creation, and the restored monarchy of the messianic age to the seventh day, on which God rested. The seven numbered stanzas of the dedicatory poem correspond to the seven sections of this introduction. Although the subject of the governance of contemporary Jewish society is unusual for early modern Jewish writings, the work is representative in some ways. It shows the remarkable association with Spanish literary and political culture among the converso-descended Sephardim of Amsterdam, it describes a fairly typical communal organization, and it tells us about the flourishing of literary 'academies' among some elite Jews. The interest in contemporary Jewish life as an object of exposition and analysis could also be seen as characteristic of the period, similar to Leone Modena's Historia de' riti hebraici, but concerned with cultural and political matters rather than with specifically religious practices.

The Triumph of Popular Government,

And of Dutch Antiquity

Dedicated in the Year 5443.

DANIEL LEVI DE BARRIOS.

To the most illustrious Lords Parnassim, and Gabbai of the Holy Congregation of Amsterdam,

Ishac Belmonte.                       Iacob Abendana de Brito.

Iacob de Pinto.                         Ishac Levi Ximenes.

Abraham Gutierres.                  Mordechay Franco. 

Iosseph Mocat\[a\]

The Hebrews are flowers of the law,

And the masters are bees who, among the leaves,

sustain themselves by its keepers.

PREFACE

The saintly architect of the holy people

Calls the law science, and understanding

Because it gives them happy knowledge

Of that which he covers with his glorious mantle.

The Atlases of the firmament

Sustain\* their beautiful congregation, and I sing, Unless Nessus prevents it by stealing its honor,

And the shirt of Holland poisons it.\[1\]

 \*Parnassim means "sustainers"

The triumph of the popular government I sing,

To the sweet sound of the harp of history,

In a Hebrew chorus with a voice of weeping,

Which is an echo of the Israelite memory.

The waters of the red Rhadamanthus\[2\]

Do not flood the camp of its glory.

As much as I channel Orpheus' passion,

So much do I harness the spirit of David.

Give to me O Great God! in erudite zither, A pen so sweet, and hand so resonant,

That it will serve as wings to your blessed law,

And that it will resemble your fiery dawn.

To the judges who consider your infinite 

majesty dwelling among angels, 

I offer that which I sing, and that which I write, Because through these, I receive your light.
