description: "In this presentation, Adam Teller discusses the change of status
  of Jews in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth from the subjects of the King in
  the late medieval period to subjects of lords, in private dominions during the
  early modern period. He contrasts two legal documents: a privilege granted to
  Jews by King Kazimierz Jagiellończyk (1453) and a privilege granted to Jews in
  the town of Jampol by the town's owner."

## **Source 1 Introduction**

This privilege of August 1453 – only a small part of whose 46 paragraphs is presented here -was one of the most short-lived ever granted to the Jews of Poland. The King, Kazimierz Jagiellończyk (1447-1492), seems to have wanted to extend his power over his country’s Jews (note the usage, “Our Jews”), a significant urban population who played an important role in developing regional and national markets. The privilege - by which is meant not only its legal content but its physical form - was an expanded version of privileges previously granted to the Jews of Poland by Jagiellończyk’s ancestor, Kazimierz the Great in the mid-14th century, which were themselves a slightly expanded version of the first charter of rights granted to Polish Jews by Bolesław the Pious in Kalisz, 1264. However, Jagiellończyk’s version gives the Jews a number of new economic concessions. (Notice, however, that these new concessions are granted under the guise of simply renewing a previous privilege burnt in the Poznań fire). It is also the first privilege explicitly to give state backing to the organs of Jewish autonomy in Poland (paragraph 7). It was this state backing which was to allow the highly complex and sophisticated development of Jewish communities and regional councils in future centuries. However, if in this important aspect, the privilege of 1453 looks forward to future developments, in other stipulations it is clearly medieval in nature. These are the references in clauses 6 and 7, as well as in one version of the conclusion (here brought in square brackets), which demarcate the Jews as belonging to the Royal Treasury. This status of “servi camerae” was one of the characteristics of Jewish legal status in Europe during the high Middle Ages, which disappeared as a result of constitutional changes in the early modern period. In Poland, these changes stemmed from the strengthening of the nobility at the expense of monarchy. The first sign of this development was seen in 1454, where the Polish nobility, gathered at Nieszawa, forced the King to grant them a number of concessions, including the weakening of his control over Poland’s Jews and the consequent cancellation of this privilege.

In the Name of the Lord, Amen. As a perpetual memorial, We, Kazimierz, by the grace of God, King of Poland, as well as of the lands of Krakow, Sandomierz, Sieradz, Leczyca and Kujawa, Grand Duke of Lithuania. Hereditary Lord of Pomerania and Ruthenia, give notice by this present document to all those whom it may benefit, both now and in the future, who have knowledge of this document: That before Our Majesty appeared as delegates Our Jews from the lands of Great Poland, namely from the Palatinates of Poznań, Kalisz, Sieradz, Łęczyca, Brześć, and Włocławek, and the districts pertaining to them, and related: That the laws which they had previously received from the most serene prince of blessed memory, Our predecessor, Lord Kazimierz, King of Poland, and which they had always enjoyed in the times of the other kings, Our predecessors, and in our day, at all times and occasions, were reduced to ashes by the fire when before Our very eyes Our city of Poznań, in Our presence, was consumed in a firestorm. They \[i.e. the Jews\] are requesting and humbly supplicating that we should graciously agree to renew, ratify, and confirm the laws, according to a copy of the said laws which they have shown us. Which laws thus given, copied word for word, read thus.

...

Sixth. That no Captain (_Starosta_) or Palatine (_Wojewoda_) should \[exact\] from the Jews any payments, namely taxes and exactions, unless the Jews themselves give them of their own free will; this is because We have made them part of Our treasury.

...

Seventh. That if any Jew should not be obedient to his elders, he should pay a penalty of three marks to the Lord Palatine and similarly a penalty of three marks to his elders.

...

And we also stipulate that any Jew who holds hereditary property through an agreement \[i.e. mortgage\] should not be made to ride out to war, nor to make any \[financial\] contribution to the expedition, because these Jews are a part of Our treasury.

...

And We, the aforementioned, King Kazimierz, having listened to the laws of the above Jews, and after requisite deliberations with certain of the Counsellors of Our kingdom, having reviewed, examined, and considered the individual points, clauses, and conditions which appear in them \[i.e. the laws\], and desire that the Jews whom \[we reserve to Ourselves and Our kingdom as a special treasury\] should recognize that they they have received the relief of our happy kingdom for the Jews in the lands of Great Poland, namely in the Palatinates of Poznań, Kalisz, Sieradz, Łęczyca, Brześć, and Włocławek, as well as in the districts, towns and small towns belonging to them, both for those resident there now and for the others who will come to the lands of Great Poland from other places. We renew, ratify, and confirm the laws described above in all their points, conditions, articles, and clauses, and with the determination that they shall have eternal and perpetual force, in testimony to the present document, our seal is appended.

Made in Kraków, 13 th August 1453

This privilege, granted to a small community in what is today Ukraine (the 1765, census notes 293 Jews in Jampol), illustrates the extent to which Jews were integrated into the life of the town in the 18 th century. The basis for this integration was the economic policy of the Polish nobility - in particular, the wealthiest magnates. In order to reconstruct the economy of their estates following the destruction of the mid-17 the wars, the magnates initiated a policy of encouraging Jewish settlement and economic activity. The legal basis for this was a law of 1539, which removed the Jews on noble estates from royal control, leaving them entirely under the jurisdiction of the nobility. This put an end to the Jews' medieval status of "servi camerae" and allowed each community to negotiate its own settlement terms separately. Since the magnates recognized the Jews as a highly effective economic force, they were prepared to grant them very favorable conditions. The Jews' economic importance was largely felt in the realm of the production and sale of alcoholic beverages - the so-called propinacja monopoly, which the estate owner granted Jewish businessmen on lease (arenda). Though their dependence on their noble lords could sometimes leave the Jews exposed to persecution at their hands, in the vast majority of cases, the economic services the Jews gave meant that they could rely on help and support. This may be seen here not only in the broad concessions granted to the Jews in the realms of trade and crafts, but also in the permission to build a synagogue, mikveh and cemetery (and to use wood from the estate owner's forests). The magnate estate owner also lent his support to the community council (kahal) and the Jewish courts, even allowing the Jews themselves to try cases where a Christian was the plaintiff. However, the most striking example of Jewish integration into urban structures in this document is the stipulation of the magnate estate-owner that the Jews of Jampol should be active participants in the municipal council. This was an extremely rare concession and should in no way be taken as representative of the situation in the overwhelming majority of Polish and Lithuanian towns and cities in this period. It should be noted that almost all the forms of Jewish integration into 18th century urban life in Eastern Europe were possible only due to noble support. The non-Jewish townspeople remained hostile to the Jews, whom they saw as economic competitors and religious enemies, but could not easily express their hostility for fear of invoking the wrath of their lords. From time to time, however, this hostility did find expression: in Jampol, the townspeople, with the support of the local bishop, accused the Jews in 1756 of murdering a local Christian boy.
