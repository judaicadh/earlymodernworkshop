description: "In this presentation, Adam Teller discusses the change of status
  of Jews in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth from the subjects of the King in
  the late medieval period to subjects of lords, in private dominions during the
  early modern period. He contrasts two legal documents: a privilege granted to
  Jews by King Kazimierz Jagiello≈Ñczyk (1453) and a privilege granted to Jews in
  the town of Jampol by the town's owner."
