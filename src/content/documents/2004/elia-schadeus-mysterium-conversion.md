  Mysterium: About the Conversion of the Jews: As was situated and preached in
  the Strasbourg cathedral. Das ist Geheimnis S. Pauli Rom am II Von Bekherung
  der Juden als gelegt und geprediget zu Strassburg Munster. Strasbourg, 1592


  Elias Schadeus (1541-1593) held various pastoral positions in Strasbourg's
  Lutheran churches, beginning in 1570 until his death. In 1586, Schadeus was
  appointed as a Hebrew professor at Strasbourg's university. Like many of the
  Christian Hebraists in Strasbourg, Schadeus composed various grammatical
  textbooks, teaching students Hebrew grammar and language in an effort to
  instruct them in the truths of Christianity, based on the Hebraica Veritas.


  Schadeus also applied his knowledge of Hebrew in an attempt to actively
  convert the Jews. In his role as preacher at Strasbourg's cathedral from
  1581-1593, Schadeus preached tolerance of the Jew. Echoing the notion
  expressed by Martin Luther in his 1523 treatise, That Jesus Christ was Born a
  Jew, Schadeus argued that Christian kindness and economic inclusion would
  facilitate Jewish conversion. In addition, Schadeus founded a Hebrew printing
  press, through which he hoped to attract the Jews to Christianity through
  printed media in their own language. To this end, he translated five books of
  Luther's New Testament into Judaeo- German, which he published together with a
  preface, excerpts from the Old Testament, some of his sermons and additional
  arguments intended to attract the Jews to Lutheranism.


  Included in this published volume is a supplication to Strasbourg's council,
  in which Schadeus beseeches the magistrates on behalf of a young Jewess he had
  baptized as Susanna. His request, written ten years after her baptism, is that
  Susanna be granted the status of a Stattkind, a ward of the city. This status
  and the stipend involved would help combat her poverty and facilitate her
  marriage by enabling her to work within the city. This text reflects Schadeus'
  position that economic tolerance of Jews and of converts would facilitate
  conversion to Christianity. It also documents the desperation felt by Jewish
  converts to Christianity, who had difficulty integrating into both their old
  and new societies.

    rich-text: The endowment of 20 _fl_. which was given to _Stattkinder_ was
      designed to help them begin working at a craft within the city, subject to
      the limits imposed by guild regulations. By awarding Susanna with such a
      stipend, and by allowing her to work and to marry in the city, the
      magistrates were effectively giving her the same rights that a burgher
      would have, without requiring her to purchase the _Burgerrecht_. These
      benefits, in turn, could serve as her dowry, for her husband would be
      permitted to work. As someone born in Wurtemberg, he would not have had
      the rights of a burgher without purchasing them from the city.

Copy of a Supplication to the respectable Magistrates of the City of Strasbourg, \[in the\] year 1591, the third of January, offered on behalf of a baptized Jewess, in order to obtain both her rights as a burgher and her marriage tax. And this is laid out here \[for\] the respectable council to honor, and for others in the same situation, as an example of the following.

Stern, noble, honorable, cautious, wise, gracious men, \[who\] command respect:

Although I, Your Honors, am requesting only one thing, this has not happened previously in this place for perhaps one hundred years or more. So I hope to God, that after you yourselves will have heard the total cause and that which was done, that you, in accordance with your godly force and high understanding, will know how to be Christian and reasonable.

This concerns, however, contemporary people, and specifically, a woman who was born out of the Jewish people \[and whom\] was brought to me eleven years ago, through the love of God, a wonderful and gracious sending. Half a year, she was in my house and was instructed correctly in Christian thought, after which she was settled with Christ and his beloved church, through baptism at Old St. Peter's, which is at present, a large community. From that same time on, for ten whole years, she has been in service at her godmother's and godfather's, Herr Johann Adolph Fursten. She behaved both in her service and in the neighborhood, making herself known, that her Christian and merciful change was \[out of\] complete love. And through the good testimony of the present-day joiner guild, \[one\] of whom, born in Wurtemberg \[she\] desires to marry, and according to his honorable manly law, he needs letters from their godfathers, Johann Adolph Fursten \[and\] Johan Jacob Stossern, also from me, to state it.\[^1\] Thereby, their wedding will be confirmed with a public and orderly church going.

Now, however, she cannot be admitted, neither domestically nor as a burgher, without citizenship. \[^2\] And she is both poor, and other than her dress, brings together nothing more than that which her Godfather and Godmother and other good-hearted and Christian people have relieved her with. So, I personally appear before you, heartfelt, and I, as her poor patron, in writing, submit subserviently and humbly, that Your Honors, will take and adopt this person,\[who is\] so totally born again, and who has been held for so long as a Christian, as a ward of the city.

Upon examination, she is related by blood to Christ, who adopted us heathens with spiritual and heavenly citizenship. \[She\] wants the Christian faith, and is a daughter of Abraham. Because of that, it is reasonable; she enjoys the believing patriarchs, prophets and apostles, and yes, the Master Christ more than she pays the stubborn and latter \[day\] Jews. She wanted and waited for the Christian religion, and was required to abandon her people, father, mother, friends, also nourishment and heritage.

This is also law of the gentiles, and oh, should be observed, and \[it\] is also customary under the Turks, that those individuals \[who\] come from other peoples, and accept the religion and enter into a place where their profession is performed, should become accepted equally in the community of all civic rights and freedoms. After all, God the Master, \[at\] different times in the Old Testament, ordered and gave the commandment, through Moses, that the stranger, that is, those from the heathens who made their way \[into Jewish territory\] shall be treated with the same standard and law as the Jews have, and should be appreciated. \[This idea\] was also observed in every time, and when it was not observed \[he who did not observe it\] was strongly punished by the prophets. And it is particularly mentioned that in the Second book of Chronicles, the strangers were counted, and they themselves \[added up\] to a large sum, namely 153,600 were found, and they were used in the Building of the Temple.\[^3\] And that which occurs in the Old Testament should be reasonable in the New Testament, and when the page is turned, it is also observed. Upon examination of the reasons of the Apostle Paul, reported in Romans 11, and here, for the beloved, I wish to shorten, because I handled this in detail in a midday sermon a few weeks ago, and it is not necessary to repeat.

So then, now, Your Honors, I hope that in the wake of the indicated reasons, you will adopt as a ward of the city, and nobly accept \[this woman.\] I will provide the endowment in its entirety, so that nothing is repugnant, or work against this, even though she wants the twenty gulden for the beginning of her craft, through which other poor Christian wards of Your Honor are recognized, or a tax from elsewhere should come forth.\[^4\]

Therein, I prescribe nothing, Your Honors, except for that which Christ wants of honorable Jews, also from all of the believers in the Father Abraham, the beloved prophets and apostles, who were former Jews. From them and through that which is heathen to us, holiness and much good comes. I have only asked and indicated, and this, in all subservience, I want to have placed in your hands: the complete hope that not only will contemporary people gratefully present and show themselves as Christian holy people \[and\] God-forceful pietists, but also that the Master, Christ himself, through his proper will, will repay such credit in various ways \[to\]Your Honors and the whole city with rich blessings.

Because of that, then, I ask daily. And to do such a journey also with diligence, I, who see myself as responsible, hereby will have also asked. \[^5\]

Subservient Citizen and Preacher, M. Elias Schad
