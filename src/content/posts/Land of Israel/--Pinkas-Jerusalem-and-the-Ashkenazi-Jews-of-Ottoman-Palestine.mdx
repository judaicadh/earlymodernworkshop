The record book \[pinkas] of Jerusalem, the Holy City, may it be rebuilt swiftly in our days.

Today, Tuesday, 11 Heshvan 5372 since creation \[1612 CE], all the deposits that belong to the holy community of Jerusalem were transferred to me, whether belonging to the collective or to individuals.

I received one sack upon which was written “To R. Elia ha-Kohen and to R. Shliml, may God protect them, who dwell in Jerusalem,” and in it are 91 ½ gurush, and this amount is to be distributed. I took 10 gurush from it as a loan and I signed for it, as I was commanded by the gabbai R. Benjamin b. R. Yekutiel. Another 5 gurush for cheese which I bought for this same R. Benjamin. I remained indebted for another ½ gurush to R. Simon Uri and the citrons which I sent to the holy community of Jerusalem. Another 26 gurush real and I left them here in the city to exchange them \<and among these 26 gurush was one counterfeit gurush Çelebi> and in the sack there remained 55 gurush, and I sent them to Jerusalem.

Today, Thursday, the Torah portion of Vayishlah, I sent 25 gurush and ½ gurush \<reales> and in them a gurush Çelebi which remained in my hands to give to someone and was discovered to be counterfeit. In its place, I gave a gurush real and I disbursed ½ gurush, and this is the account: ¼ gurush and 6 parrts from the letter of R. Tebele, another 5 pieces for the myrtle which I sent before the Sukkot holiday and the rest to be kept for any expense. Another ¼ gurush I sent to give to my donkey driver \[muqeri] to untie the bag of the perfect sage R. Hiyya Rofe and to tie it \<and to place the 25 gurush inside> and the perfect sage did not want to untie it. Then I gave it to a traveling man named R. Abraham Soriano from the holy community of Manisia, and the ¼ gurush remained in my hand. In total are to be found 26 gurush and these are the aforementioned 26 gurush reales. Another 5 \[gurush] to the beadle of the communities to gather the rabbis of the city about the matter of R. Eliezer Araha.

I also received another sack which belongs to the holy community \[of Jerusalem] and the seven tovim of the Ashkenazi community in Safed took 145 thaler \[from it]. 122 thaler \<from this amount> are from the debt since the holy community of Ashkenazim in Safed lent to the holy community of Jerusalem. Until such a time as it is determined that this aforementioned amount, that is 122 thaler, are a total debt \<they shall be repaid from those 122 which they withheld in their hands> and if it is determined that these 122 thaler are from their portion, the holy community of Ashkenazim in Safed will be obliged to give the remainder which belongs to their portion. Another 18 \<gurush> which makes 25 gold Polish, from the yield of the money of the great sage R. Fish to distribute to the poor of Jerusalem, which were taken by R. Solomon Fish by permission of R.

Another 96 dreier, another 3 vierer.

Other deposits: One volume belongs to R. Yakos. Another deposit belongs to R. Benjamin from Poznan. Another volume belongs to two women, Rebecca wife of Sender and Liabent wife of Baruch. I sent these three deposits to Jerusalem, but the volume which belongs to the rabbanit, the widow of R. Samson Bak, was taken from my hands by R. Aaron ha-Kohen due to the letter of R. Moshe Bak.

Selection 3: A Scholarly Economy

\[f. 143v]

With a good omen, with the help of heaven, we began to study in the study hall \[hesger] of the elder and distinguished R. Noah son of R. Solomon from the Torah portion of “How goodly are your tents, Jacob” \[Balak]. We did not study for the entire month of Tishrei because the holidays occupied our time.

R. M. Castiles must repay from the Torah portion of Tavo when he fell sick in his legs until Rosh Hashanah 5378 \[1618], and for all of Tishrei we did not study in the hesger. Also, he needs to repay from the Torah portion of Lekh Lekha until the Torah portion of va-Yera. From the month of Heshvan he did not study anymore, and \[I] need to obtain 1 ½ gurush from him.

R. I. A. needs to repay from his account for the week before Rosh Hashanah when he went to study in Meron. He also needs to repay for when he went to Jerusalem from the Torah portion of va-Yikra until the eve of Passover. He also needs to repay the Torah portion of Behukotai and Bamidbar when he went to study in Meron. Also, for the Torah portion of Naso when he fell into his sickbed until the \<end> of the Torah portion of Korah. Also, from the Torah portion of Nitsavim va-Yelekh he went to Meron until Rosh Hashanah. Also, he did not come \[beginning] from the Torah portion of Noah, and afterwards he went to Jerusalem. \[I] need to extract from his portion for an entire year, 6 ½ gurush.

R. Joseph Hayyim needs to repay a week from his account, combined with 3 days when he fell sick and 20 days in the building \[!]. He also needs to repay from the Torah Portion of va-Yetze when he fell sick until the Torah portion of Pequdei. Also, he needs to repay the Torah portion of Behuqotai since he went to Meron. Also, for the Torah portion of Bamidbar since he went to the holy community of Tiberias until the end of the Torah portion of Korah. He also needs to repay from the Torah portion of Ekev due to his sickness when he took to bed, until the Torah portion of Tavo when he passed away to his eternal home and let go of life. I need to extract from his portion \[the payment for] 23 weeks of an entire year, which is 11 ½ gurush. From the year 5377 \[1617 CE], he is owed from the second year when the money came, for six weeks, that is 3 gurush.

For all of these we withdrew 19 ½. From this we must subtract 1 gurush which we gave to Simha the son of R. M. Castiles. Another 2 gurush are in the hands of my mother-in-law to distribute as she chooses. Another 2 gurush \[are to be paid] to the writer as payment for his labor.

I must repay to R. Leib for half of all the days of the winter, also from the beginning of the month of Iyar until 24 Tammuz.
