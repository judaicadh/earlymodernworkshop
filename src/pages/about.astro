                The Early Modern Workshop was established to highlight the history of Jewish life as an inseparable part of the broader historical narratives. It brings into focus the interactions, contributions, and influences of Jewish communities within the contexts of early modern history.

                Scholars of early modern European history have identified this era as one of significant transformation: centralization of states, the spread of printing, economic innovations, demographic shifts, and improved communication. These factors have been tied to intensified cultural activities, social discipline, and evolving identities. Similarly, Jewish historians have long studied this period but often missed its connection to concurrent changes in the non-Jewish world. The "early modern" concept in Jewish history is a relatively new framework, bridging the medieval and modern eras.

                History rarely fits into neat chronological breaks. The Early Modern Workshop recognizes both the distinctiveness of the early modern period and its continuity with preceding and subsequent eras. This project fosters academic discussion by examining Jewish lifeâ€™s developments during this transformative era while situating it firmly within general history.

                Since 2004, the Early Modern Workshop has convened annually to explore various aspects of early modern Jewish history. This website presents the outcomes of these workshops: a collection of primary sources, translations, and scholarly analyses, complemented by video and audio lectures accessible on iTunes University.
